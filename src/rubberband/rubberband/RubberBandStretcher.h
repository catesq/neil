    /**
     * Processing options for the timestretcher.  The preferred
     * options should normally be set in the constructor, as a bitwise
     * OR of the option flags.  The default value (DefaultOptions) is
     * intended to give good results in most situations.
     *
     * 1. Flags prefixed \c OptionProcess determine how the timestretcher
     * will be invoked.  These options may not be changed after
     * construction.
     * 
     *   \li \c OptionProcessOffline - Run the stretcher in offline
     *   mode.  In this mode the input data needs to be provided
     *   twice, once to study(), which calculates a stretch profile
     *   for the audio, and once to process(), which stretches it.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionProcessRealTime - Run the stretcher in real-time
     *   mode.  In this mode only process() should be called, and the
     *   stretcher adjusts dynamically in response to the input audio.
     * 
     * The Process setting is likely to depend on your architecture:
     * non-real-time operation on seekable files: Offline; real-time
     * or streaming operation: RealTime.
     *
     * 2. Flags prefixed \c OptionStretch control the profile used for
     * variable timestretching.  Rubber Band always adjusts the
     * stretch profile to minimise stretching of busy broadband
     * transient sounds, but the degree to which it does so is
     * adjustable.  These options may not be changed after
     * construction.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionStretchElastic - Only meaningful in offline
     *   mode, and the default in that mode.  The audio will be
     *   stretched at a variable rate, aimed at preserving the quality
     *   of transient sounds as much as possible.  The timings of low
     *   activity regions between transients may be less exact than
     *   when the precise flag is set.
     * 
     *   \li \c OptionStretchPrecise - Although still using a variable
     *   stretch rate, the audio will be stretched so as to maintain
     *   as close as possible to a linear stretch ratio throughout.
     *   Timing may be better than when using \c OptionStretchElastic, at
     *   slight cost to the sound quality of transients.  This setting
     *   is always used when running in real-time mode.
     *
     * 3. Flags prefixed \c OptionTransients control the component
     * frequency phase-reset mechanism that may be used at transient
     * points to provide clarity and realism to percussion and other
     * significant transient sounds.  These options may be changed
     * after construction when running in real-time mode, but not when
     * running in offline mode.
     * 
     *   \li \c OptionTransientsCrisp - Reset component phases at the
     *   peak of each transient (the start of a significant note or
     *   percussive event).  This, the default setting, usually
     *   results in a clear-sounding output; but it is not always
     *   consistent, and may cause interruptions in stable sounds
     *   present at the same time as transient events.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionTransientsMixed - Reset component phases at the
     *   peak of each transient, outside a frequency range typical of
     *   musical fundamental frequencies.  The results may be more
     *   regular for mixed stable and percussive notes than
     *   \c OptionTransientsCrisp, but with a "phasier" sound.  The
     *   balance may sound very good for certain types of music and
     *   fairly bad for others.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionTransientsSmooth - Do not reset component phases
     *   at any point.  The results will be smoother and more regular
     *   but may be less clear than with either of the other
     *   transients flags.
     *
     * 4. Flags prefixed \c OptionPhase control the adjustment of
     * component frequency phases from one analysis window to the next
     * during non-transient segments.  These options may be changed at
     * any time.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionPhaseAdaptive - Lock the adjustments of phase
     *   for frequencies close to peak frequencies to those of the
     *   peak, but reduce the degree of locking as the stretch ratio
     *   gets longer.  This, the default setting, should give a good
     *   balance between clarity and smoothness in most situations.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionPhasePeakLocked - Lock the adjustments of phase
     *   for frequencies close to peak frequencies to those of the
     *   peak.  This should give a clear result in situations with
     *   relatively low stretch ratios, but a relatively metallic
     *   sound at longer stretches.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionPhaseIndependent - Do not lock phase adjustments
     *   to peak frequencies.  This usually results in a softer,
     *   phasier sound.
     *
     * 5. Flags prefixed \c OptionThreading control the threading
     * model of the stretcher.  These options may not be changed after
     * construction.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionThreadingAuto - Permit the stretcher to
     *   determine its own threading model.  Usually this means using
     *   one processing thread per audio channel in offline mode if
     *   the stretcher is able to determine that more than one CPU is
     *   available, and one thread only in realtime mode.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionThreadingNever - Never use more than one thread.
     *  
     *   \li \c OptionThreadingAlways - Use multiple threads in any
     *   situation where \c OptionThreadingAuto would do so, except omit
     *   the check for multiple CPUs and instead assume it to be true.
     *
     * 6. Flags prefixed \c OptionWindow control the window size for
     * FFT processing.  The window size actually used will depend on
     * many factors, but it can be influenced.  These options may not
     * be changed after construction.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionWindowStandard - Use the default window size.
     *   The actual size will vary depending on other parameters.
     *   This option is expected to produce better results than the
     *   other window options in most situations.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionWindowShort - Use a shorter window.  This may
     *   result in crisper sound for audio that depends strongly on
     *   its timing qualities.
     *
     *   \li \c OptionWindowLong - Use a longer window.  This is
     *   likely to result in a smoother sound at the expense of
     *   clarity and timing.
