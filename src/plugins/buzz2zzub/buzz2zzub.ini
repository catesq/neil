; buzz2zzub configuration file.
;
; This file controls how libzzubs buzz wrapper loads buzz machines. Due to
; the lost source code of original Buzz, some (important) plugins poke inside
; the memory of buzz.exe to provide special features. All of these hacks are
; to some extent documented, and we know where the plugins poke. Thus, we can
; "simply" search & replace the binary contents of the DLL and replace the
; Buzz offsets with our own - and the plugins magically work!
;
; A patch line looks like this:
;
;   PatchXX=YYY:ZZZ
;
; Where:
;
;   XX  = patch number, goes from 0 to Count-1
;   YYY = machine DLL name
;   ZZZ = patch command
;
; A patch command can be one of the following:
;
;   patch-seq              - patch the sequencer hack
;   patch-bpm              - patch the BPM hack
;   patch-midi             - patch the midi hack
;   patch-replace(XXXX..,YYYY..) - searches for binary representation of XXXX
;                            and replaces with binary YYYY. XXXX and YYYY are
;                            hex strings and must be of identical lengths
;   noload                 - do not load this machine (bye "GetInfo() called")
;   lock-add-input         - forces calls to AddInput on the GUI thread.
;                            This fixes crashes in machines that use GUI
;                            after adding inputs.
;   lock-set-tracks        - same as above, but for SetTracks.
;
; If a machine needs multiple patches, add a line for each patch.
