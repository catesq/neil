libmodfile - a cross platform C++ library for reading wave and pattern data
from Amiga and PC tracker modules. Supports .MOD, .S3M, .XM and .IT (x86 only)

Currently supports .MOD, .S3M, .XM and .IT.

Examples: 
	modextract - WTL UI for exporting .WAVs to disk with libsndfile
	moddir - dump names of all waves in a module to the console

TODO:
	- generic access to envelopes
	- error checking and improved fault tolerance
	- support more formats: .XI, .ITS, .BMX, .SF2
	- simplify imported patterns - we dont need dynamic buzz style patterns
	- fix for PPC systems
