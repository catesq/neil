	<h1>Cloud synthesizer</h1>
	Cloud is a grain synthesis based synthesizer. It takes a wave file and 
	plays back short parts of it with varying parameters that are chosen at 
	random from a given range. Each such short part is called a grain. You
	can select it's length, starting offset into the wave file, envelope 
	parameters, rate, etc. You can specify the probability for playback
	during each processing cycle (currently 256 samples).

    <tr>
      <td><b>Wave</b></td>
      <td>
	This allows you to pick a loaded wave file from a wave slot by name.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Offset Mean (%)</b></td>
      <td>
	The mean offset into the wave file. This is the percentage by which
	the playback is skipped in to the wave file. For example setting this
	to 50% will start the playback from the middle of the file for each
	new grain.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Offset Devi</b></td>
      <td>
	This and other devi (deviation) parameters let you adjust how much
	will the actual value deviate randomly from the mean value that you
	set using the mean parameters. For example if offset mean value ranges
	from 0% to 100% then setting Offset Devi parameter to say 0.1 and 
	setting Offset Mean to say 50% then the actual value will be from 
	the interval (40%, 60%) picked at random. This works the same way
	for all the other parameters.

    <tr>
      <td><b>Amp Mean</b></td>
      <td>
	Each grains output is multiplied by the value specified by this 
	parameter thus scaling the volume down if it is set to something
	less than 1. You use it to either avoid clipping when alot of grains
	are playing at the same time or with the devi parameter to allow grains
	of different volumes.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Amp Devi</b></td>
      <td>
	Deviation value for the amp parameter.

	The length for which each grain will be playing in miliseconds.

    <tr>
      <td><b>Sustain Mean (%)</b></td>
      <td>
	This value stands for the percentage of time (which was specified with 
	the length parameter) that wil be spent in the sustain stage.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Sustain Devi</b></td>
      <td>
	Deviation value for the sustain parameter.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Skew Mean</b></td>
      <td>
	Skew in this case means the amount of playback time that will be spent 
	in the attack stage. If skew is set to 50% than it means that both 
	attack and decay stages will be given equal time. If it is set to 20%
	it means that attack will be given 20% of the time that is left after
	accounting for sustain and release will be given the remaining 80% thus
	attack will be shorter than release. You get the picture.
      </td>

      <td><b>Skew Devi</b></td>
      <td>
	Deviation value for the skew parameter.
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td><b>Rate Mean</b></td>
      <td>
	Playback rate for each grain - 0.0 means that each grain plays at the 
	original rate, 1.0 means that the it is played twice as fast, -1.0 that
	it is played twice as slow etc.

      <td><b>Pan Mean</b></td>
      <td>
	The panorama position of the grain. Here -1.0 means panning hard left 
	and 1.0 means panning hard right, the other values cover the rest of the
	panorama spectrum.

      <td><b>Density</b></td>
      <td>
	Probability that a grain will be triggered for playback at each given
