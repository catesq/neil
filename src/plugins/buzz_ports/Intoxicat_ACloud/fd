If you want to keep the power constant, then (L^2 + R^2) should be constant.
One way to do that is to use sine and cosine curves for left and right
because (sin^2 + cos^2) = 1.

   pan = 0.0 to  PI/2
   LeftGain(pan) = cos(pan)
   RightGain(pan) = sin(pan)

Zeph\k0d3	yes
	Zeph\k0d3	otherwise:
	Zeph\k0d3	L = sin(angle)*left + cos(angle)*right R = sin(angle+PI/2)*left + cos(angle+PI/2)*right
	Zeph\k0d3	only the PI/2 is dependent on the angle between speakers
	
	Zeph\k0d3	im not sure if I got that completely right.... just from memory
	Zeph\k0d3	I think I messed up the sin/cos.. they should be switched
	Zeph\k0d3	because sin(0) = 0.. it would mean that L = 0*left + 1*right on 0 angle
	Zeph\k0d3	nice thing about this pan is that you can swap ears as well.. like turn your back to the sound
	Zeph\k0d3	and constant power level too.. cos^2 + sin^2 = 1
