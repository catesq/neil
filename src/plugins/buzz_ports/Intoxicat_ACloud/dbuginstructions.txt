can you copy your instructions from before again? I lost them in the crash
	Zephod	[22:52] <Zephod> 1) build debug build
	Zephod	[22:53] <Zephod> 2) make a backup copy of the gear folder and wipe all gens/effects
	Zephod	[22:53] <intoxicat> "teach youself c++ in 30 days didnt cover it" ;)
	Zephod	[22:53] <Zephod> 3) hit "run" in vc++
	Zephod	[22:53] <Zephod> 4) give buzz.exe as startup executable
	Zephod	[22:53] <Zephod> 5) use f9 to set a breakpoint in the code
	Zephod	[22:53] <Zephod> once the code reaches the breakpoint, it will halt execution and show you the contents of all the variables etc
	Zephod	[22:53] <intoxicat> ah
	Zephod	[22:53] <Zephod> you can even change the code it is running and recompile during run
	Zephod	[22:54] <Zephod> but an advanced version of the breakpoint lets you specify the condition on which is will break... like "only break in this envelope if the result is 0"
