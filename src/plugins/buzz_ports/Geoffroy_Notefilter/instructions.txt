If you want to rename the project and workspace you need to this:
1. Open all files (*.cpp, *.h, *.dsw and *.dsp) to a text editor
2. Developer file naming:
   - Replace all the references "ch_template" to your liking from all the files.
   - This affects the way developer files are named
3. .dll naming:
   Replace all the references to "ch template" from ch_template.dsp to what your machine's filename to be
   .dll will be added to the name.
4. Save and close the files
5. Rename files from ch_template to whatever you replaced ch_template in step 2.

Open the project and change the output paths
1. Alt-F7 / Link / General / Output file name

the default output paths are designed for a directory setup like this:

buzz\
buzz\gear\effects\
buzz\gear\generators\
buzz\buzz.exe
buzz\mydev\project
buzz\mydev\buzz.exe
buzz\mydev\gear\effects\
buzz\mydev\gear\generators\

By default debug builds go to buzz\mydev\gear\effects and
Release builds to buzz\gear\effects
This way the debug builds will stay in their own folder. You need
a working Buzz setup in buzz\mydev\ to use buzz. It doesn't need to
be a complete copy.

How to code the plugin itself:

1. Open the workspace
2. Start with .h file, work from top to bottom
3. Once you have the .h file done, move to .cpp file. Top to bottom again.
4. When you reach the end of .cpp file you should have a working plugin.
5. Compile and start Buzz
6. Debug...
7. Once you have the plugin finished, compile a release build

Happy coding ;)
