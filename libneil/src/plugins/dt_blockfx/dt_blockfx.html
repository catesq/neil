<p align="left"><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p align="left">DT Block Fx performs FFT block based effects. Example uses are:
<li>equalization
<li>brick-wall (sharp roll off) filtering
<li>noise reduction (or increase)
<li>sound smearing/loop click removal
<li>non-harmonic frequency shifting (without aliasing)
<li>new filtering effects such as "electrosparkle" and "liquid"

<p align="left"><strong>Short theory</strong></p>

<p>This effect works differently to most others - instead of filtering or distorting
sample data directly it does its thing directly on the frequency spectrum.

<p>How does it do it?
<ol>
<li>The input sample data is cut into overlapping blocks
<li>Each block is transformed to a frequency spectrum using the Fast-Fourier-Transform
<li>An effect is applied to the spectrum
<li>The frequency spectrum is inverse transformed back to sample data
</ol>

<p align="left"><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<P><i>Buzz installation</i>
<p>Copy dt_blockfx.dll, dt_blockfx.prs
to your <i>&lt;buzz root&gt;</i>\Gear\Effects directory.
<p>Copy fftw_2.1.3_float.dll to <i>&lt;buzz root&gt;</i>.
<p>The default <i>&lt;buzz root&gt;</i> is <font face="courier" size=-1>c:\Program Files\Jeskola\Buzz</font>

<p><i>FruityLoops installation</i>
<p>The <i>dt_blockfx_allglobal.dll</i> version is included for use with FruityLoops and
the <i>Buzz Effect Adapter</i>. It differs from <i>dt_blockfx.dll</i> in that it has the
equivalent of 4 sets of track params implemented as global params. If you load
<i>dt_blockfx.dll</i> into FruityLoops there will only be one set of track params
availble.

<p>To use with FruityLoops, copy 
dt_blockfx_allglobal.dll, dt_blockfx_allglobal.prs to your
<i>&lt;fruity loops root&gt;</i>\Plugins\Fruity\Effects\Buzz Effect Adapter</I> directory.
<p>Copy fftw_2.1.3_float.dll to <i>&lt;fruity loops root&gt;</i>.

<p>The default <i>&lt;fruity loops root&gt;</i> is <i>C:\Program Files\FruityLoops3.5</I>.

    <td>Only available in the pattern editor. Forces synchronization of the
block with the start of tick for use with block sizes of 512 or longer. 
<p>
Set to <b>1</b> if you want an audio block to be aligned exactly
with the current tick. If the paramaters aren't changed then this can generally be
left unset.

<p>If not set then effects will not be in precisely time with your music. For block sizes
longer than a tick (e.g 125 beat/min, 4 ticks/beat, the tick length in samples is 5292) then
paramaters from some ticks will be ignored unless this is set. 
<p>
If need be you can set to <b>1</b> on every tick at the expense of CPU.

    <td>Only available in the pattern editor. Generally only useful for block sizes of 4096
or shorter.
<p>The following values are valid:

<p><b>0</b>: Normal interpolation of parameters - overlap, freqA, freqB, etc are calculated
using values from the current tick, next tick and the playing sample position.

<p><b>1</b>: No interpolation - parameters are fixed for the duration of each tick.

<p><b>2</b>: Continue previous - Parameter interpolation is continued from the
previous tick (i.e. overlap, freqA, freqB, etc are calculated using values from the previous
tick, the current tick and the playing sample position).

is sufficient then the requested <i>BlockLen</i> will be used, otherwise the largest
possible block length will be used.
<p>Longer block lengths result in a smoother sound and give a higher frequency
resolution but need more delay and more CPU. Short block lengths can add a
liquid or sparkling quality to the sound.

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" nowrap><font color="#004080">Contrast</font></td>
    <td>
	<p>This effect changes the <i>contrast</i> or dynamic range of
frequencies present in the sound.

<p>Increasing contrast (<i>Value</i> &gt; 0.5) results in the reduction of noise
and softer frequency components. When applied heavily all but the loudest frequencies
remain and the envelope is removed. Useful for reducing distortion and un-muddying sound.

<p>Decreasing contrast (<i>Value</i> &lt; 0.5) results in the increase of lower level
frequency components. This tends to flatten the frequency spectrum and increase
noise. Useful for adding "body" to samples.

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" nowrap><font color="#004080">Smear</font></td>
    <td>
	<p>This effect randomizes the phase of the spectrum data which results in
the reduction of the sound envelope.</p>
<p>The <i>Value</i> parameter controls how much randomization: 0 for none and 1 for 100%</p>
<p>Sound smearing can be used to remove loop clicks and give sustain to any sound. It
is similar to a super-soft reverb with large <i>BlockLen</i>.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" nowrap><font color="#004080">Clip</font></td>
    <td>
	<p>Clip causes frequency components greater than a particular level 
(set using <i>Value</i>) to be clipped to that level.</p>
	<p>This is another way of reducing the dynamic range of frequency
components but it differs from <i>Contrast</i> in that the lower level
components are not increased.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" nowrap><font color="#004080">Weed</font></td>
    <td>
	<p>Weed removes frequency components above (<i>Value</i> &lt; 0.5)
	or below (<i>Value</i> &gt; 0.5) a particular level.
	<p>Removing components below a particular level increases the
dynamic range of frequency components by leaving only the louder components.
This can be used to remove noise from the spectrum or if applied strongly, leave
only the loud components.
<p>Removing components above a particular level means that only the
softer components remain. This means that background and lower level
harmonics of a sound are increased.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" nowrap><font color="#004080">ShiftAdd</font></td>
    <td>
<p>ShiftAdd shifts the spectrum segment by the <i>Value</i> specified (0.5 corresponds
to no shift).
The shift is non-harmonic meaning that it will not generally
sound musical on tuned sounds.
ShiftAdd mixes the original spectrum with the shifted segment.
