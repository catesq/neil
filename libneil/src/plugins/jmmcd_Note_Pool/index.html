jmmcd Note Pool (copyright &copy James McDermott 2004-2008)

<P CLASS=List>&not;&not;
purpose
<br>
sending note-on messages to generators based on crude probabilistic algorithms.
<P>

<P CLASS=List>&not;&not;
installation
<br>
should be installed automatically by the Armstrong build script
<P>

<P CLASS=List>&not;&not;
global parameters
<br>
<P CLASS=SubList>&not;&not;
prob([C-B]): the *relative* probability that each pitch will be chosen, when the machine is choosing a pitch for you.
<P CLASS=SubList>&not;&not;
prob(Off): the note-off message is treated just like any other note.

<P>
<P CLASS=List>&not;&not;
track parameters
<br>
<P CLASS=SubList>&not;&not;
note: the note sent to each assigned generator.
<P CLASS=SubList>&not;&not;
volume: the value sent to the volume parameter of each assigned generator.
<P CLASS=SubList>&not;&not;
probability: the probability that a note will be played this tick.
<P CLASS=SubList>&not;&not;
centre note: determines the octave in which the notes will be played.
<P CLASS=SubList>&not;&not;
octave deviation: determines the amount of randomisation applied to the octave.
<P CLASS=SubList>&not;&not;
volume deviation: determines the amount of randomisation applied to the volume.
<P CLASS=SubList>&not;&not;
dot-prob: the probability that a note will be played on an empty tick.
<P CLASS=SubList>&not;&not;
target track: the generator track to which notes will be sent.
<P CLASS=SubList>&not;&not;
on/off: set to on to allow improvisation.


<P>
<P CLASS=List>&not;&not;
attributes
<br>

usage hints
<br>
there are a few ways of using this machine. the laziest (and my
personal favourite) is to set the note probabilities to correspond to
the key i'm working in, turn the dot-prob to a suitable value, and let
it play while i work on something else.
<br><br> if you prefer, you can specify most of your patterns exactly,
and allow the machine to improvise only a couple of notes here and
there. if you know, for example, that you need a note on tick 20, but
don't want to decide what one, set the probability (not the dot-prob)
to 100% on that note.
<br><br>
or you can do something in between.
<P>

<P CLASS=List>&not;&not;
known bugs
<br>
i don't know anything about midi. does this machine work with midi?
should it work differently?
<br><br> it should be possible to record the notes and volume values
sent in the generator's tracks. this *was* working (it should work
automatically, without help from the programmer) but it's not now. any
ideas?
<br><br>
any suggestions or comments are welcome.

<P>
<P CLASS=List>&not;&not;
source code
<br>
the source code for this machine is included for educational and
collaborative purposes under the GPL. feel free to work with it.

<P CLASS=List>&not;&not;
thanks
<br>
thanks to oskari, cyanphase, btdsys, and all the devs for making buzz
what it is. thanks to btdsys, 7900, usr, and kodream for answering
peer questions. thanks to everyone who has released source code. but
mostly, especially, many thanks to btdsys for the peer library: it's
the best thing that ever happened to buzz.

<br><br>
thanks to all the authors of Aldrin and Armstrong also.

<br><br>

if you like this machine, and want to thank me for making it, please
go and thank other more important developers first. when you're
finished, if there is still gratitude in you, you can send me a cd of
your music, or a postcard, or an email
(jamesmichaelmcdermott@gmail.com).
