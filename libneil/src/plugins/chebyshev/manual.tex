\title{SoMono Chebyshev}

\SetTableToWidth{\textwidth}

SoMono Chebyshev is a distortion plug-in based on the Chebyshev
polynomial $T_n(x)$ which is defined here as $T_n(x) = cos(n \times
arccos(x))$. $x$ in this case is an input sample whos' value ranges
from $-1$ to $1$ and $n$ is a free parameter that you can choose with
a parameter slider. Only odd integer values are allowed for $n$
because even values result in a nasty DC bias due to the fact that if
$x = 0$ then $T_n(x) \in \{-1, 1\}$ when $n$ is an even
integer. Chebyshev results in a warm harmonic distortion when applied
to clean sounds (such as guitar or the TB-303). You can adjust the
input gain thus also adjusting the strength of distortion and output
gain to prevent clipping.
