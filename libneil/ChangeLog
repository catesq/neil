libzzub 0.2.1
=============

=== Bugs fixed

#294: denormalization performance issues

	some plugins, such as Lunar Filter, seem to still generate denormalization
	issues. Knark uses up to 100% CPU after half of playing time.
	
	libzzub supports now SSE optimization.
	
#295: cpu performance not correct

	currently, cpu performance seems to be hardcasted to 1%.
	
=== Enhancements

#297: add gcc backend to lunar


	LLVM/LLVM-GCC are too bleeding edge at the moment, users have trouble installing.

	therefore, add a statically, GCC compiled backend that precompiles lunar
	code to native shared objects.
	
#296: remove LADSPA/DSSI support

	LADSPA/DSSI were just implemented as a proof of concept and to have a few machines
	to test in the beginning. they can not be shipped with ccm files and thus break
	the ccm specification.


libzzub 0.2
===========

=== Enhancements

#282: new "logarithmic" attribute for lunar

	new bool attribute "logarithmic" for lunar parameters. parameters with this flag 
	will be interpolated across the natural logarithmic instead of a linear interpolation.

#284: new set of lunar plugins

	new set of lunar plugins:

		* delay
		* panning
		* filter
		* kick
		* reverb
		* synth (now with svf and adsr envelope)

#285: llvm backend for lunar

	lunar stores regular source as well as llvm 1.9 bytecode with each ccm
	
#286: rename zzub_metaplugin_ to zzub_plugin_

	since there is no "plugin" handle exposed, use "plugin" instead of 
	"metaplugin" in c interface.
	
=== Bugs fixed

#287: ccm corrupts if waves have wrong samplerate

	if waves saved with a samplerate other than 44100, flac fails. 
	
#290: loops not properly synched

	when a loop begin is set and the current position is in front of the loop, 
	the position is not being adjusted.
	the song stops on loop end, not on song end.
