Chapter 1. Introduction

   Welcome to the Aldrin User Manual. In this book you are going
   to learn how to master Aldrin, a powerful music composition
   software for the GNU/Linux operating system. Its compact and
   integrated structure allows you to write electronic music
   without requiring expensive audio gear, but in case you have
   those already, they can be easily utilized as well.

   Aldrin features a flexible audio routing system commonly found
   in expensive audio software, enabling you to mix, split,
   mutilate and modify audio signals emitted by software
   synthesizers and samples. An ever-expanding number of included
   plugins ensures that you never run out of good sounds. The
   wavetable organizes your samples and sampler patches, enabling
   multiple instruments to share the same set of sounds. The
   classic tracker interface supports sequencing rhythms and
   melody patterns using your PC keyboard as a piano. Finally, a
   multitrack sequencer organizes your overall song structure,
   allowing you to arrange patterns along a vertical timeline.

   With Aldrin, you're no longer alone. Exchange songs with
   others, remix and extend unfinished works. Aldrin embeds easy
   access to Freesound, the online sample library for creative
   commons licensed sounds. Aldrins CCM song format contains
   everything required to faithfully reproduce a composition on a
   different installation: patterns, sequences, sounds, effects,
   instruments, everything is preserved in a compact and
   extensible format.

Chapter 2. Walkthrough Guide

   The Aldrin walkthrough should give you a quick and helpful
   introduction into Aldrin. By the end of reading this chapter
   you will know how to install Aldrin, load generators and
   effects, write patterns and arrange those patterns in a
   sequence.
     _________________________________________________________

2.1. Installation

   Aldrin is open source and therefore its releases are source
   code only - no binaries. If you use a popular distribution of
   GNU/Linux, chances are that your local package manager already
   offers an Aldrin package. If not, you will need to build
   Aldrin yourself.

   Independent of which distribution you use, building and
   installing Aldrin shouldn't be hard, given that you follow
   this guide. If you have trouble installing Aldrin, please
   contact your distribution maintainers and ask them to include
   support for Aldrin.

   First make sure that you have all programs and libraries
   installed required to build Aldrin. Usually, all of them
   should be provided by your distribution of GNU/Linux. Please
   check with your distributions package manager documentation on
   how to search and install packages. You are going to need
   following packages:

     * Python 2.4 or later.
     * wxPython 2.6 or later, although 2.6 is recommended.
     * ctypes, if you are using Python 2.4. Since Python 2.5,
       ctypes is included.
     * SCons 0.96.92 or later.
     * pyzzub 0.2.2 or later. pyzzub is a specialized component
       based on libzzub that your distribution is most likely not
       supplying. Please see the installation guide for libzzub
       for details.

   Aldrin packages can be downloaded from the SourceForge.net
   project website. You can either download a release or build
   Aldrin from the source repository. In this guide, we are going
   to download a release.

    1. On the project website, click on Downloads to see
       available releases. You will see the downloads page on
       which one or more releases are listed.
    2. Download the sources of the most recent release. Usually,
       the link should be named something like Aldrin x.x Source
       Release (x86, .tar.bz2), where x.x is the release number.
    3. Unpack the downloaded sources into a new folder. You will
       get a new subfolder named something like aldrin-x.x:
[paniq@aspera tmp]$ tar -vxf aldrin-x.x.tar.bz2
...
aldrin-x.x/CREDITS
aldrin-x.x/INSTALL
aldrin-x.x/ChangeLog
aldrin-x.x/LICENCE
    4. Change into the newly created folder and run scons to see
       if everything is fine:
[paniq@aspera tmp]$ cd aldrin-x.x
[paniq@aspera aldrin-x.x]$ scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
scons: `.' is up to date.
scons: done building targets.
    5. Please make sure that any previous versions of Aldrin have
       been uninstalled from your system before proceeding with
       the next step.
       Now install aldrin to your system (you will need root
       rights for this):
[paniq@aspera aldrin-x.x]$ sudo scons install
Password:
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
Install file: "bin/aldrin" as "/usr/local/bin/aldrin"
...
scons: done building targets.
       If you don't want to install aldrin systemwide, create a
       folder in your home directory and change your installation
       prefix:
[paniq@aspera aldrin-x.x]$ mkdir ~/usr
[paniq@aspera aldrin-x.x]$ scons install PREFIX=/home/paniq/usr
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets ...
Install file: "bin/aldrin" as "/home/paniq/usr/bin/aldrin"
...
scons: done building targets.

   You are now ready to run Aldrin for the first time.
     _________________________________________________________

2.2. Running Aldrin

   If you installed Aldrin systemwide, you can find Aldrin in
   your desktop environments start menu in the section Sound &
   Video.

   If you installed Aldrin into your homefolder, you have to run
   it manually. In the previous example, we installed Aldrin to
   /home/paniq/usr, which means that the applications start
   script aldrin will reside in /home/paniq/usr/bin. Run that
   script.

   You will be greeted by a splash screen that fades when Aldrin
   has been fully initialized. During startup, Aldrin will guess
   the best sound driver available and run it. If there was a
   problem during initialization of the sound device, you will be
   notified of the problem and asked to pick a different
   configuration in the Preferences dialog.

   Pretend that everything has worked correctly. Your startup
   screen should be looking like this:

   Figure 2-1. Aldrin main window after first start.

   [aldrin_startview.png]
     _________________________________________________________

2.3. Configuring Aldrin

   Most likely, you will want to configure Aldrin a bit before
   you get started. If it hasn't opened automatically, open the
   preferences by selecting View->Preferences... from the menu.
   The preferences dialog will reveal itself to you:

   Figure 2-2. Aldrin preferences window (Audio tab).

   [aldrin_preferences_wave.png]

   The Audio tab is usually selected by default. It allows you to
   change settings related to audio output. Following explanation
   of parameters should you give a better understanding on what
   to choose.

   Device
          The output device you wish to use. This usually lists
          JACK (if enabled), ALSA and OSS output drivers
          available on your system. All of these drivers require
          exclusive access to the soundcard for performance
          reasons, so make sure you have no other sound
          applications active in the background. I recommend ALSA
          to be tried first, then JACK, then OSS.

   Samplerate
          The samplerate at which to render audio in Hz (impulses
          per second). 44100Hz is usually a good setting (CD
          Quality). The higher your samplerate is, the more
          performance Aldrin consumes to render sound. With a
          lower samplerate, Aldrin consumes less CPU time, but
          the sound quality is degraded.

   Latency
          The time between the rendering of a signal and the
          actual output on the soundcard. Latency controls the
          size of the internal audio buffer that data is being
          rendered into before it is sent to the soundcard. A low
          latency value will give you a better response time,
          while a higher latency value gives you better
          performance. A value of 5-10ms should be acceptable.

   Once you have set up your favorite settings, hit Apply to test
   your new settings. If everything works correctly, move over to
   the Sound Library tab:

   Figure 2-3. Aldrin preferences window (Sound Library tab).

   [aldrin_preferences_wt.png]

   The Sound Library window allows you to manage a list of sample
   repositories. In order to access samples on your harddrive,
   you should at least add one sample repository. Click on
   Add..., then choose a folder to add.

   If you want to download samples online from within Aldrin, you
   need to supply your freesound credentials. If you don't have a
   freesound account yet, visit the website and get yourself one.

   If you are using external MIDI gear, you should have a look at
   the MIDI and Controllers tabs. They allow you to select MIDI
   input/output devices and configure MIDI controller bindings.

   Aldrin allows you to use your keyboard like a 2-octave piano.
   Depending which keymap you use, you need to select a proper
   keymap on the Keyboard tab:

   Figure 2-4. Aldrin preferences window (Keyboard tab).

   [aldrin_preferences_kb.png]

   These are the most important settings. Once you are done
   adjusting, hit OK to apply your preferences and close the
   preferences window.
     _________________________________________________________

2.4. Making Some Noise

   Now that Aldrin is set up, you are ready to create a very
   small song, consisting of one plugin, one pattern and one
   sequence. This is a repeating process for every new song, and
   every new instrument you introduce.
     _________________________________________________________

2.4.1. Right Where It Belongs: Routing Plugins

   You should now be back where you begun:

   Figure 2-5. The router view.

   [aldrin_startview.png]

   What you are seeing is the Router View of Aldrin. It allows
   you to chain generators and effects to define a processing
   order of signals. What does that mean? Let's try an example.

   Right-click somewhere in the empty space of the view. You
   should see the routers context menu. Select Makk M4wII. A new
   generator plugin will appear at the coordinates where you
   right-clicked the view:

   Figure 2-6. A new plugin.

   [aldrin_newplugin.png]

   The Makk M4wII is a quite feature-rich synthesizer, imitating
   an analogue synth model. Right now, the M4wII is not connected
   to the master output, and thus you will not be able to hear
   anything. Connect the synth to the master by clicking the
   plugin with the middle mouse button, and dragging the
   appearing arrow to the master plugin. You can also connect
   machines by holding Shift and using the left mouse button.

   Figure 2-7. A router connection.

   [aldrin_connection.png]
     _________________________________________________________

2.4.2. The Core of Composition: Editing Patterns

   Now that the synth is created, hit the F2 key to show the
   Pattern View.When you create a generator, Aldrin automatically
   adds a first empty pattern for you to work on, so you should
   now see the empty pattern:

   Figure 2-8. The pattern view.

   [aldrin_pattern.png]

   In this pattern, time flows vertically, while actual changes
   in parameters are arranged horizontally. When a parameter does
   not change, it's associated column only shows one or more
   dots. You can click on fields or use the arrows on your
   keyboard to navigate in the pattern. For each column, the
   status bar will display the row index, the column index, the
   current value, it's readable representation, if any, and a
   long description of the parameter.

   It is possible that you can not see the entire pattern width,
   so you need to move to the first track. Hit Tab to jump to the
   first track, then use the keyboard to enter a few notes into
   the first column named Note:

   Figure 2-9. A pattern track with a few notes entered.

   [aldrin_patterntrack.png]

   As you enter each note, M4wII will be triggered to play that
   note, allowing you to preview what you are writing. The cursor
   travels down by one row. You can change the pattern length and
   name either by selecting Pattern Properties... from the
   pattern views context menu, or using the keyboard shortcut
   Ctrl-Backspace.

   Figure 2-10. Pattern properties.

   [aldrin_patternprops.png]

   Name
          The name of the pattern. Aldrin usually enumerates
          patterns with a sequence like 00, 01, 02, and so on,
          but you are free to choose your own names.

   Length
          The length of the pattern in rows (= ticks). You can
          see from the TPB edit field at the top of the main
          window that the song is currently set up to 4 "ticks
          per beats", which is the number of rows that is being
          played per beat. One bar consists of four beats, so
          that's 4x4 rows = 16 rows - precisely the number of
          rows that your pattern has right now. The dropdown box
          provides you with a set of defaults for different speed
          and bar settings.
     _________________________________________________________

2.4.3. Putting It All Together: Sequences

   Once your pattern contains some notes, you will want to put
   your pattern into your songs sequence. In order to do that,
   hit F4 to enter the Sequence View. You will see a screen that
   looks like this:

   Figure 2-11. Sequencer View.

   [aldrin_sequencer.png]

   Since you created a generator, the sequence view already
   contains a track for the M4wII, but it is currently empty. By
   moving left and right with the arrow keys on your keyboard,
   you can change the time index. Moving up and down will change
   the track and plugin you are adding patterns for. On the right
   side of the window, there is a Pattern List, which lists the
   available patterns you can put into that track. Each pattern
   is prefixed by the name of the key that you should press on
   the keyboard to place that pattern into the sequence. In our
   example, pressing 0 will put pattern 00 in the current track
   at the current time index your cursor is at.

   Now hit F5 to listen to what your song sounds like. F8 will
   stop the song. Your first track - although a bit bland and
   simple - is finished!
