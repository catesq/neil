        analogue synth model. Right now, the M4wII is not connected to the
        master output, and thus you will not be able to hear anything. Connect
        the synth to the master by clicking the plugin with the
        <SPAN
CLASS="mousebutton"
>middle</SPAN
> mouse button, and dragging the
        appearing arrow to the master plugin. You can also connect machines by
        holding <B

        parameters are arranged horizontally. When a parameter does not
        change, it's associated column only shows one or more dots. You can
        click on fields or use the arrows on your keyboard to navigate in the
        pattern. For each column, the status bar will display the row index,
        the column index, the current value, it's readable representation, if
        any, and a long description of the parameter.</P
><P
>It is possible that you can not see the entire pattern width, so
        you need to move to the first track. Hit <B

              beat. One bar consists of four beats, so that's 4x4 rows = 16
              rows - precisely the number of rows that your pattern has right
              now. The dropdown box provides you with a set of defaults for

        contains a track for the M4wII, but it is currently empty. By moving
        left and right with the <B

>arrow keys</B
> on your keyboard, you
        can change the time index. Moving up and down will change the track and plugin
		you are adding patterns for. On the right side of the window, there is a <SPAN
CLASS="interface"
>Pattern
        List</SPAN
>, which lists the available patterns you can put into
        that track. Each pattern is prefixed by the name of the key that you
        should press on the keyboard to place that pattern into the sequence.
        In our example, pressing <B
CLASS="keycap"
>0</B

        current track at the current time index your cursor is at.</P
><P
>Now hit <B

        although a bit bland and simple - is finished!</P
