        How do I Play the Pattern I just Created?
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       Aldrin Tracker still lacks the &quot;Play current pattern&quot; feature, 
          due to its different structure. First of all, the machine you created 
          must be connected to Master. After this, when entering notes to the 
          pattern, you will hear them play.
       <br />
<br />
       To play the pattern, you need to add the pattern to the Sequence editor 
          and then play the song. To play a pattern that's in the middle of the 
          song, you need to create a temporary loop. Press
       <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
         CTRL-B
        </b>
</font>
       where the loop should start, and
       <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
         CTRL-E
        </b>
</font>
       where it ends. (You can then 
          remove the loop by pressing these keys at the begin (CTRL-B) and end (CTRL-E) of the song)
       <br />
<br />
       To hear only a single instrument you've created, the machine must be Soloed 
          from the Machine Layout page. You can also mute/unmute tracks by clicking 
          on their title bars with the mouse in the sequence editor.

        How do I retrigger/play the note sequence I just entered?
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       Unfortunately there is no way yet to do this directly in Buzz. Perhaps the feature 
          will be added later.

        How do I quickly jump to a pattern to edit it when I am in sequence view?
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       Just move the cursor to the pattern and
       <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
         press 
          Enter
        </b>
</font>
       . This works just like pressing &quot;G&quot; in the 
          order list in IT.
       <b>
<font color="#FF0000">
         Pressing Enter
        </font>
</b>
       again in the pattern editor brings you back to the Sequence editor. 
          This allows you to quickly jump between the sequences and patterns to 
          edit them.

        How do I jump to different parts of the song when playing it?
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       Click the tick numbers (in the left-most column of the sequence editor) with 
          the mouse. The line which displays what part of the song is played will 
          move and the song will play from there. However, the patterns are not 
          interrupted when this is done, so some longer drum loops etc. may continue 
          playing until they finish. This may be changed later on.

        How do I create a tracker-like multi-tap delay, with each delay 
          with its own panning?
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       Connect the source signal directly to Master. Create a plain Delay, 
          and set its dry through to 0. Connect the source signal to this delay, 
          and the delay to Master. Then create a second Delay, and also set its 
          dry through to 0. Connect the first delay to the second delay, and the 
          second delay to Master. Now, you can adjust the volume level and panning 
          of the source and both the delays separately. If you need more delays, 
          simply add to the chain. Another way to do this job is to just route the
		  generator signal through a more advanced delay like the FSM Panzerdelay. 
		  Which simply has it's own seperate parameters for the left and right delays

        There are no NNAs. How should I deal with this?
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       Live with it. However, this is not such a problem, as some machines 
          actually have extra dynamic channels of polyphony per track (such as 
          PluckString and PrimiFun), and most of them have efficient anti-click. 
          Using delays and reverbs also helps to fight sudden note cut.
       <br />
<br />
       And you never know, a Tracker machine with NNAs just might come up someday.

        How do I create a cool gapped sound often used in tracker songs?
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       Use Arguelles GoaSlicer. It's actually easier that way, than typing 
          volume commands to every row.

        There's no vibrato, nor panning envelopes. What do I do?
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       Some synthesizer machines have vibrato (or an LFO which can modulate 
          the pitch). Jeskola Tracker has no vibrato, but other trackers have it. 
		  Try Mathilde tracker for instance.
       <br />
<br />
       To add vibrato to any signal, use Rout Vibrato. However, it does the 
          vibrato with pitch shifting / timestretching, so it tends to click with 
          extreme values. Make it subtle. Also, Rout Vibrato only processes an 
          incoming signal and is unaware of any note data, so you cannot make 
          the vibrato delayed unless you're willing to create the vibrato its 
          own pattern(s).

        ow do I create cool chip-like waveforms?
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       In thousands of ways. Begin with Psi Corp's Wave Ass. 
		  It allows you to draw your own waveforms.
