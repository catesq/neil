   Recording Parameter Movements

      You've most likely noticed how powerful and versatile the real-time functionality 
        of changing machine parameters works in Aldrin. But now its time to actually 
        record (commit) your &quot;tweaks&quot; as you perform them.
      <br />

       Lets try this on the PrimiFun:
       <br />

<ol>
<li>
        Switch to the
        <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
          Machine Editor (F3).
         </font>
</b>
</li>
<li>
<font color="#ff0000">
<b>
          Double-click the PrimiFun
         </b>
</font>
        to open its parameter window.
       </li>
<li>
<font color="#ff0000">
<b>
          Press F7 or click the red record button
         </b>
</font>
        on the top toolbar.
       </li>
<li>
<font color="#0000ff">

<a href="adjusting_parameters.html">
           Change 
          various parameters

</font>
        on the PrimiFun with your mouse.
       </li>
</ol>
      You've just recorded your slider movements! You will immediately notice 
      that as the song loops through its 16 notes (the default loop length), it 
      will play your changes.

      Important Note:
     </b>
   What you have just done is script various 
      parameter values in real-time to the current pattern. You will now learn 
      how to edit these directly within in the pattern itself.

       Important Note 2:
      </b>
      Recording parameter 
            movements requires a pattern to which the parameters should be 
            recorded. Logically, recording will only work when the machine that 
            you want to record parameter changes of, has a pattern that is being 
            played in the sequence at the moment you change the parameters 
            (
      <b>
<a href="understanding_sequence_editing.html">
        adding patterns to the sequence
       </a>
</b>
      is done in the sequence editor).
     </p>
   <p>
      When you want to record 
            parameters of e.g. an effect, which's column hasn't been inserted in the sequence 
			editor yet, make sure you
      <a href="Adding%20Columns%20(Machines)%20to%20the%20Sequence%20Editor">
<strong>
        add it's column to the sequence editor
       </strong>
</a>
      before you can add a pattern, before you can start 
            recording.
