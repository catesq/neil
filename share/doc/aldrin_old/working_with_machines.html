      Please note that the 
      following information is extremely important to understanding the basic 
      theories behind composing and experimenting with Aldrin. If you do not understand 
      these principals, you will not get very far. Please pay close attention.

   Each individual machine within Aldrin contains its own 
      unique set of parameters, which build or filter the sounds made by that 
      machine.
   <br />
   <br />
   One of the most powerful concepts and features in Aldrin, is the ability 
      to easily adjust, script, and even record the movement of any of these 
      parameters within absolutely any machine placed on the Machine Editor 
      surface.
   <br />
   <br />
   While this concept may at first seem difficult to understand, it will 
      quickly prove to be the true power behind Aldrin, and offer more control then 
      any audio application available today.

   To open the current parameter list of a machine, simply
   <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
       double click on it
      </b>
</font>
   (or
   <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
       right-click and 
      select Parameters
      </b>
</font>
   ... from the pop-up menu). Note that the vertical 
      size of the list brought up will vary from tiny (a simple Gain effect) to 
      huge (the Megasynths such as the ZX7).
