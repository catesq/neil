<b>
        Use Multiple Trackers
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       Divide your songs into elements and parts. Each machine has its own 
          patterns therefore you can - and should - divide your song into different 
          elements. Instead of playing all samples through one tracker, use several 
          trackers, one for drums, another one for pads / chords, etc. The fun 
          point is that each one of these can have its own different dsp effects 
          (reverb, chorus, distortion, etc.). This also allows console style mixing 
          with the Jeskola Mixer.
       <br />
<br />
       Arranging the song is also easier this way. You don't need to duplicate 
          an entire pattern just to change the drum loop while everything else 
          remains the same.

<b>
        Use the Synths!
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       You don't even NEED to use samples, thanks to the wide variety of software 
          synthesis machines available. They produce clean sound, a lot cleaner 
          that could be obtained with samples, because resampling always loses 
          some information.
       <br />
<br />
       Also, you can change the synthesizers' parameters on the fly. You 
          can give the sounds much more variety than would be attained with samples 
          (unless you go through the trouble of creating multiple samples).

        Don't Bother With Creating Extra Notes for Delays
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       Aldrin has a nice variety of different Delay effects to suit your needs. 
          The basic Delay machine actually uses less CPU time than the extra tracker 
          channels used for &quot;artificial&quot; delays as they are only simple 
          delay buffers, while tracker-made note delays involve resampling and 
          mixing extra channels with possible effect commands.
       <br />
<br />
       To create a tracker-like multi-tap delay (with a specified panning for 
          each tap), perform the actions listed 
          in the

        Sequence Editor vs. Order List
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       While Impulse Tracker has just a single-column order list, the Sequence 
          Editor in Aldrin is a different world. This is where all the separate 
          elements you've created come together. It may seem confusing at first, 
          but after you got used to it, you wouldn't go back to normal order 
          lists.
       <br />
<br />
       Remember that the Sequence Editor's accuracy is one tick (=pattern row). 
          You can zoom in / out by changing the Step value, either from the menu, 
          or by pressing
       <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
         Shift + and Shift -.
        </b>
</font>
       This allows you to place your patterns with one-tick accuracy if needed. 
          Mind you, if you offset the patterns by an uneven amount of ticks, they 
          may disappear when you zoom out. However, they are still there.
       <br />
<br />
       Playing new patterns in a track always interrupts the previous one. 
          You can also interrupt a pattern on purpose with the Break or Mute command (
       <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
         press 
          comma or period
        </b>
</font>
       in the sequence editor).

        Effects and Master can have their own tracks.
        <br />
</b>
<br />
       While only Generators get tracks automatically created for them in the 
          sequence editor, you can actually create tracks and patterns for any 
          machine, including the Master output.
       <br />
<br />
       The Master patterns can control master volume, BPM/TPB and the volume 
          / panning of each input separately. This allows you to fade in and fade 
          out different machines. You can also do groove quantizing through the 
          Master, by alternating the TPB or BPM between two values. Be warned, 
          though, that Delays that are synchronized to ticks will go out of sync 
          if the TPB keeps changing.
       <br />
<br />
       All other machines, for example filters, can have their parameters changed 
          during the song. This allows you to control the amount of reverb or 
          create interesting filter sweeps that are fully controllable, for instance.
       <br />
<br />
       It is also possible to create two or more tracks for one machine. One 
          of them can play a pattern which contains a short note arpeggio, while 
          another one can play a long pattern that has an interpolated parameter 
          sweep. This way you can use the same parameter sweeps for any note sequences 
          you create.

        F2, F3, F4. Use Them.
       </b>
<br />
<br />
       In Impulse Tracker, you jumped between the main windows with F1 .. F4. 
          In Aldrin, you use
       <b>
<font color="#FF0000">
         F2, F3, F4 for Pattern Editor, 
          Machine Layout and Sequence Editor
        </font>
</b>
       , which are the main windows. 
          Use them every time you can and refrain from using the mouse, and you'll 
          learn them in no time.
       <br />

        Only Machines Connected to the Master May be Panned
        <br />
</b>
<br />
       This may be confusing, and seem limiting at first (as Impulse Tracker 
          allows you to pan every track or even every instrument and note separately), 
          but it is not such a drawback. Most &quot;instruments&quot; you create 
          with Aldrin are chains of machines anyway, handled as one whole signal.
       <br />
<br />
       Some effects produce stereo output (examples: Stereo Reverb, X-Delay). 
          If these machines are connected to Master, the Pan control acts as a 
          Balance control. If you try to connect a stereo output to a mono input 
          effect (not all effects support stereo input, which is up to the developers 
		  of the effects), Aldrin will ask you which channel (left or right) you want to 
          connect.
