   Recording Parameters

   <p>
      One of the most exciting features in Aldrin, is the ability to record your 
        parameter movements to patterns, which are then easily sequenced into 
        your songs. What this allows, is to tweak any sound parameter within any 
        machine and record them; completely in real-time. This is accomplished 
        by the following steps:
     </p>
   <p>
      1.
      <font color="#ff3333">
<b>
        Create a pattern
       </b>
</font>
      for the current 
        machine (note: generators have a default pattern generated automatically)
      <br />
      2.
      <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
        Add the pattern
       </b>
</font>
      to the sequence.
      <br />
      3.
      <b>
<font color="#ff3333">
        Press the record button
       </font>
</b>
      on the 
        toolbar (or
      <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
        press
       </font>
</b>
<font color="#ff0000">
<b>
        F7
       </b>
</font>
      )
      <br />
      4.
      <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
        Move any parameter
       </b>
</font>
      .
      <br />
<br />
      All parameter movements will instantly appear
        on the pattern, where you fine-tune by editing the numbers. The 
        next time the pattern is played, the sliders will move by themselves 
        exactly as you had moved them while recording (watch the example in the 
        figure).

        Tip:
       </strong>
</span>
      It 
        is sometimes useful to create loops 
        in the sequence, and let Aldrin continually loop through a pattern while 
        you record various different parameters.
     </p>
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
<strong>
       Note:
      </strong>
</span>
   Make sure that your cursor is 
            positioned at the beginning of the pattern you want to record in the 
            sequence editor before you begin to record by pressing F7.
   <p>

<strong>
       Note 2:
      </strong>
</span>
   The parameters 
            that you record will be placed in the parameter column together with 
            the parameters that are already there. So especially when 
            after recording (changing while
   <em>
      record
     </em>
   is enabled) the same 
            parameters in a pattern for the second time, probably your parameter 
            values will no longer be useful. Clear the column in pattern editor and 
            try again. This happens for example when you set Aldrin to loop 
            through that pattern more than once and you keep on changing parameters 
            in the parameter dialog while Aldrin goes through that pattern for the 
            second time.
