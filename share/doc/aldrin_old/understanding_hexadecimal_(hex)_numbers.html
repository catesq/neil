      most likely understand how a Hex number system works.

<br />
      Hexidecimal is a numeric system slightly different then what most are 
      currently used to. The standard system of counting we use today is called the 
      &quot;Decimal system&quot;, also called
      <span class="bolder">
       Base 10
      </span>
      . 
      This means that all numbers are based on the number 10 (more specifically 
      0...9, 10..90, etc). The Hexidecimal system differs as it is based on the 
      number 16 and promptly named
      <span class="bolder">
       Base 16
      </span>
      (Thus the 
      term Hex). Hexadecimal number systems are very common on computers, since 
      they allow higher numbers to be placed in smaller areas of memory, or in 
      our case - in a smaller area of the screen.To stay with symbols we are familiar 
      with; hex uses A-F for all numbers past 9. Thus, a hexidecimal string representing 
      numbers of 1 through 20, would be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, 
      D, E, F, 10, 11, 12, 13 and so on. This is how many large numbers will be 
      accessed in Aldrin, and have been accessed in every tracker written. To comfirm 
      the concept, let me illustrate visually. The following chart shows numbers 
      in both Base 10 (decimal system, right) and their equivalents in Base 16 (hexidecimal 
      system, left). Please note that the numbers in this chart are very common 
      to daily Aldrin use. While you will not need to memorize anything (decimal 
      values will always appear in a

   If you do not understand this system yet, don't worry. It is one of those 
      things you master as you use it frequently. For now, just realize that numbers 
      in Aldrin are from 0 to 15, rather then 0-9, and accessed with 0-F. The rest 
      you'll pick up as you go.
