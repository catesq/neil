   Panning machines for stereo effects works exactly the same as changing, 
      recording, or scripting the

   the horizontal bar that appears only when effects are

   Although generators 
      do not have pan bars on them, you could easily achieve stereo panning by 
      simply adding a generic machine (Gains work well and serve obvious double 
      purposes), and use the stereo panner on the effect.
