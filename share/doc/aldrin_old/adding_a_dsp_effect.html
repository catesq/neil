   Adding a DSP Effect

   The main power behind Aldrin (besides its huge library of software synthesizers 
      and dsp effects) is its modular audio routing methodology. What this means, 
      is that you design the flow of audio through a serie of steps 
      (machines). This is a very powerful concept, as it lets you design your 
      own complex audio chains without the limits of physical gear.
   <br />
   <br />
   Lets start by adding a
   <b>
      delay effect
     </b>
   to our first audio chain. A delay 
      is very popular DSP effect used in most forms of electronic music. A delay 
      is basically a complex echo which usually sounds slightly &quot;spacey&quot; 
      when put on an analog synthesizer.
   <br />
   <br />
   Add the effect machine by right-clicking on the Machine Editor (
   <span class="red">
<b>
       F3
      </b>
</span>
   ) 
      and selecting
   <b>
      /New/Effects/Delay/Jeskola Cross Delay.
     </b>
   <br />
   <br />
   The delay should now appear marked as
   <b>
      X-Delay
     </b>
   in your Machine Editor.
