   <p>
      The Master machine is very important to all Aldrin songs, 
      as it is the final device before output to the audio card (or in some cases 
      Hard disk) is made. Only one master machine may exist per song, as it not 
      only controls the final output. Another useful feature of the Master machine, 
      is its inherent control over the BPM (Beats Per Minute) and TPB (Ticks per 
      Beat) of the current song.

      Scripting the master machine is done in the exact same was as
      <b>

        scripting

       </a>
</b>
      .

<strong>
        Note:
       </strong>
      The Master is added when a new 
            song is created and may not be deleted or duplicated.&nbsp;
