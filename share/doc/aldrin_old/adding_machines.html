   Adding machine in Aldrin is simple. To do so,
   <b>
   <span class="red">
       Right-click
      </span>
</b>
   your mouse
   anywhere on the 
      Machine Editor [Press
   <span class="red">
<b>
       F3 to open Machine Editor
      </b>
</span>
   ]. 
      This will open a pop-up menu containing all machines currently installed 
      on your machine; separated into the two categories
   <span class="bolder">
      Generators
     </span>
   and
   <span class="bolder">
      Effects
     </span>
   .

   The list presented by this pop-up [Figure 3.2] represents all machines 
      currently installed on your computer. Navigate with your mouse through the 
      sub-menus to view the complete list. You may
   <span class="blue">

       edit 
      this structure
      </b>
</span>
   through the
   <b>
   <span class="blue">

      </span>
</b>
   located in the
   <b>

   To add a machine, simply
   <span class="red">
<b>
       select 
      it from the list
      </b>
</span>
   , just as you would any other pop-up menu in 
      Windows. It will now appear where your mouse was positioned when you originally 
      right-clicked.

      Tip:
     </span>
   Machines may also be added 
      by double-clicking anywhere on the screen, and selecting them from the list. 
      This method is sometimes useful since all machines are listed in alpha-order, 
      making it simple to pick out a known machine.
