   Understanding Machines

   Aldrin relies on objects called Machines to generate and modify audio.    Put simply, a single machine is the equivalent of a single piece of gear in a traditional music studio.  A machine can be a synthesizer, a sampler, a dsp effect, a mixing board, or any other piece of gear that exists in a traditional music studio (and even some that can't!).
   <br />
   <br />
   The two basic types of machines in Aldrin follow:
   <br />
   <br />
   <b>
      Generators
     </b>
   <br />
   <br />
   A generator is anything which creates sound, thus begins  an audio chain in Aldrin.  Many times generators are  software based synthesizers which generate audio based on the same complex algorithm as traditional hardware synthesizers.	Other times, generators may be software based samplers, 
			used to trigger samples and instruments at various notes.
   <br />
   <br />
   <b>
      Effects
     </b>
   <br />
   <br />
   The second type of machine is called an Effect. This can be considered the equivalent of DSP effect units found in traditional studios, or as part of hardware samplers and synthesizers.
  Aldrin includes a large DSP library including Reverbs, Delays, Chorus, EQs, Distortions, Vocoders, Filters, and tons more.  It is worth noting that effects are not limited to a simple DSP algorithm.   Some effects are extremely complex, and actually contain various other  DSP effects within them, or are completely unrelated to DSP in the case of a mixing console, or visual  effect.

       Master
      </strong>
<br />
   <br />
   The last type of machine is unique in that only 
            one of it exist per song, and it may not be cloned in any way. The

   is the final output of  all songs.

   <br />
<strong>
       Templates
      </strong>
   <br />
   <br />
   Something which should not be confused with a Machine, is a Template. A template is actually a previously saved group of machines, in the form of a .BMX or .BMW (song) file.  Templates are useful when you wish to load a predefined routing of machines, or even import an existing song into your current song. Templates will be covered in more depth
