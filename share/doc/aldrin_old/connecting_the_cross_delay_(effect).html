   Now all that is left to do is to connect these machines together and output 
      them to the Master. To do this simply follow the steps you've already learned
      about
   <b>
<a href="connecting_machines.html">
       connecting machines.
      </a>
</b>
   First connect the
   <b>
      PrimiFun
     </b>
   to the
   <b>
      X-Delay
     </b>
   . 
      Next connect the
   <b>
      X-Delay
     </b>
   to the
   <b>
      Master
     </b>
   .
   <br />
   <br />
   If you did not stop the song before

<a href="disconnecting_the_primifun.html">
        disconnecting

</font>
   the PrimiFun from the Master, you will hear the new chain's output immediately. 
      If you did stop the song,
   <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
       press F5
      </b>
</font>
   to 
      start it again.

  </div>

   You may now start changing the cross delays parameters by 
      double-clicking on it to bring up its dialog box just as you had in the 
      last screen.

      Tip:
     </b>
   If you end up with a machine sound you aren't happy with, you 
      may reset it to its default parameters by selecting
   <b>
      &lt;Default&gt;
     </b>
   from the
   <font color="#0000ff">
