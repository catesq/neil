       What is a Loop?
       <br />
</b>
<br />
      What we call a 
            sample loop are two points in time saved in the sample (within an 
            instrument file) that define a loop when Aldrin plays the sample. 
            Thus Aldrin plays a part of the sample repeatedly, once the sample is triggered in 
            for example a tracker.
        A sample loop is exactly what it sounds like, a piece of a sample which 
        is meant to played repeatedly. Loops combined with envelopes are a good 
        way to add more depth and variation to simple (thus smaller) samplers. 
        Loops are a time-honored art of most studio musicians and trackers alike.
      <br />
<br />
      Aldrin allows you to define one loop for any sample in the Wavetable
      <br />
<br />

       Types of Loops
       <br />
<br />
</b>
      There are a few distinct types of loops including
      <b>
       Ping Pong loops
      </b>
      , 
        which loop from beginning to end, then back from the end to the beginning,
      <b>
       Sustaining Loops
      </b>
      which simply play a segment over and over again, 
        and
      <b>
       One-Shot Loops
      </b>
      which loop through one type and then stop.
      <br />
<br />
      Support for the various types of Loops in Aldrin is dependent on the machine 
        in use. Different machines support various different types of loops.
