   Understanding Templates
  </div>
  <div>
   A Template is simply a saved Aldrin file (BMX) which may be 
      merged into another Aldrin file. Any Aldrin song may be saved as a template, 
      and recalled at any time.
   <br />
   <br />
   Templates are a useful way to save interesting &quot;machine setups&quot; 
      so that they may be recalled and used in other songs. This lets you build 
      much more complex custom synths and effects out of existing machines, and 
      save them for later use. For example, if you had a Synth feeding into a 
      delay and a reverb to produce a very &quot;wet&quot; sounding synth, you 
      could save this &quot;setup&quot; as a template for later use.
   <br />
   <br />
   Another use for a template is to save a melody or audio-bite in order to import it
      into another song. Since templates import both Patterns and Sequence Tracks, 
      this is easily possible.
   <br />
   <br />
   Remember that a Template may include as many machines as you wish, but realise 
      that, when loaded, they will initially appear in a &quot;pile&quot;, with the 
      last-most machine showing on top. They may then be moved and reordered in 
      any way. Due to this, Templates should be kept down to as few machines as 
      possible.
   <br />

   <b>
      Bug:
     </b>
   Currently some machines experience problems when recalling samples. 
      It is a good practice not to rely on Templates to import sample sets into 
      songs. We advise to save songs without samples/waves (.BMW format), 
	  when you want to use them as a template.
