   The Elements of a Pattern

  <div>
   Now that you understand how to create a pattern let's dissect 
      one. Please study the following picture of an average pattern (in this case, 
      the

   ).

      1. Track Number
     </span>
   : The 0 at the top of this track indicates the 
            current track number. &quot;Tracks&quot; are what add

      2. Pattern Editing area:
     </span>
   A very confusing aspect 
      to most new Aldrin users is the matrix of dots they are presented with when 
      creating a single pattern. These dots appear randomly sorted into columns 
      of 1, 2, 3 or 4.. While this might at first seem chaotic and random, it 
      is very easy to understand. Each set of dots in the pattern relates to one 
      parameter for this machine. More on

<br />
      3. Row Numbers
     </span>
   : The numbers 0 to 15 on the left indicate the row 
      numbers of the current pattern. These numbers can range anywhere from just 
      plain 0 (1 row) to 0-8191 (8192 rows). Why does it start at 0 you ask? Because...

      4. Column Data:
     </span>
   The numbers appearing in this 
      column have been added in order to
   <span class="bolder">
<font color="#0000ff">
       automate
      </font>
</span>
   a parameter of this machine.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
      5. Note Data:
     </span>
   The items appearing down the first 
      column indicate that notes have been added. In this case, a C of the 5th 
      octave. These will play as the song progresses through this pattern.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
      6. Darker Rows:
     </span>
   Every 4th row in Aldrin is shaded 
      a slightly darker color (in this case a mid-gray) to indicate that it is 
      a 4th row. This helps when editing in 4/4 beats (which Aldrin is based on). 
      Also note that every 16 notes Aldrin adds an even darker color (in this example 
      Blue) to indicate a 16th row. This just helps when visually placing notes.

   <br />
   You
      should not completely understand a Aldrin pattern based simply on these instructions, 
      so keep reading. It will become clear shortly as you read and 
      experiment.
