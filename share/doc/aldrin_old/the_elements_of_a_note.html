   The Elements of a Note
  </div>
  <div>
   Although I will expect users to understand notes, I will not 
      assume they understand how notes operate within tracker style pattern editing. 
      The following is what a note appears as in Aldrin (and other trackers):

      Note Meanings:
     </span>
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
      1. Note:
     </span>
   This is simply the current note which 
      will be played. As stated, notes in Aldrin are played at the same frequencies 
      as notes in any other musical application.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
      2. Sharp:
     </span>
   Again, just as in normal music Aldrin 
      supports sharps (also known as semi-tones). It is worth mentioning that 
      Aldrin does not support flats, as they are technically the same as sharps.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
      3. Dash:
     </span>
   A dash for the second column in a note 
      simply indicates that the note is natural. Meaning it is A-G.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
      4. Octave:
     </span>
   The number at the end of a note indicates 
      its octave. It will always be a number between 0 and 9. The higher the number, 
      the higher the octave. For the musically concerned; since the base octave 
      in Aldrin is 4, middle C would be represented by
   <span class="bolder">
      C-4
     </span>
   .
