        Pattern List Elements:

<br />
<br />
<span class="bolder">
       1. Entry Key:
      </span>
      This is the number or letter value (in the case of machines with more than 10 patterns) used to insert a pattern into a sequence.
      <br />
<br />
<span class="bolder">
       2. Pattern Name:
      </span>
      This is the name given when the pattern is created in the Pattern Editor.  By default it is given a 2 digit integer starting at 00 and incremented by one each time a pattern is created.  It may be

      at 
            any time in the Pattern Editor.

<strong>
       Note:
      </strong>
      when you have capslock turned on, for example pressing the 
            &lsquo;a&rsquo; in the sequence will not have the same effect as 
            when you do that without having capslock turned on (in 
            most cases: will not have
      <em>
       any
      </em>
      effect). In other words: 
            the entry keys are case-sensitive.
