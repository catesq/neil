   To change the amount of ticks 
            (pattern rows) that one bar represents by keyboard, simply hold down
   <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
       Shift while pressing the + and - keys on your keypad
      </font>
</b>
   .  This will increase and decrease the step value, allowing you to see more or less of your song at a time. Make sure Num-lock is disabled. Alternatively, this may be done with the mouse by simply selecting a value from the drop-down list featured in Figure 3.3.
