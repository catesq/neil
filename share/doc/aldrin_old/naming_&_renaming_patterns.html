   Naming &amp; Renaming Patterns
  </div>
  <div>
   Naming patterns can be very helpful in keeping track of what 
      each pattern is doing.
   <br />
   <br />
   You may name or rename your patterns by
   <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
       pressing 
      Ctrl-Backspace
      </b>
</font>
   , and typing a new name in the text area. When you 
	  create a new pattern you will be automatically confronted with the pattern 
	  properties where you can enter the name of the new pattern.
   <br />
   <br />
   Correct naming is especially useful when you view many patterns at once in the sequence 
      view. Please consider the following thoughts and possibilities regarding 
      naming your patterns.
   <br />

      Chords and Single Note Patterns
     </span>
   <br />
   <br />
   Many times patterns are used simply to play a single chord or note of a synth, 
      pad, sample, etc. Naming the a pattern after the specific chord being used 
      makes it extermly easy to sequence multiple patterns in the seqeuncer. If 
      you do this with all of your machines you will be able to see which patterns 
      musically &quot;fit&quot; across all of the columns.

      Triggers (Utility Patterns)
     </span>
   <br />
   <br />
   Sometimes its nice to create a simple pattern which does nothing but alter 
      a set of parameters. This could be considered a trigger, or utility pattern. 
      Creating patterns which turn delays on and off, or adjust gains to various 
      levels can be very useful when sequencing large precise pieces of music.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
      Effect Sweeping Patterns
     </span>
   <br />
   <br />
   Nearly the same as a trigger, but much longer - Effect sweeping patterns 
      are useful when sliding in volumes, or dramatically changing the resonance 
      and cutoff of a synth over a long period of time. These help re-producing 
      various long variations of synth parameters and are extremely useful for 
      creating progressive synth pads. Name these "sweep down" or "slide up", for example
   <br />
   <br />
   The naming of your patterns does not need to follow any specific rules, 
      just make sure you are consistant in your naming scheme, as it will help 
      identify individual patterns among the masses as your songs grow.
