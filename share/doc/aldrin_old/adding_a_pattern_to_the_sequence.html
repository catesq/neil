   In order to play your new pattern in the 
            current song it must be added to the Sequence Editor. Switch to the 
            sequence editor by
   <strong>
<span class="red">
       pressing 
            F4
      </span>
</strong>
   on 
      your keyboard.

   You should now see a screen with one long column labeled
   <b>
      PrimiFun
     </b>
   as pictured above. This column represents the
   <b>
      sequence
     </b>
   for your newly 
      added PrimiFun machine.
   <br />
   <br />
   A sequence is nothing more then an ordered serie of patterns, relating 
      to specific machines currently added to your song.
   <br />
   <br />
   Generators are given a default sequence in the same way they are given default 
      patterns. This is designed to help work more quickly. Additional columns 
      for additional instruments may be added by pressing
   <span class="red">
<b>
       Ctrl-Enter
      </b>
</span>
   or selecting
   <b>
      Add Track
     </b>
   from the
   <b>
   <span class="red">
       right-click 
      pop-up menu
      </span>
</b>
   . You may add as many columns as you wish, including 
      multiple columns for individual machines.
   <br />
   <br />
   To add your recently created pattern to the current sequence, press 0 (zero). 
      This is the

       Entry Key
      </b>
</a>
   for the current pattern, 
      as indicated on the right in the
   <b>
      Pattern List
     </b>
   window. In this case, 
      it is the default pattern which was added by Aldrin, when you created the 
      PrimiFun machine in the Machine View.
