   Using Presets

  <div>
   <p>
      Presets are another of the new magical features recently added to Aldrin. 
        A preset could be considered a
      <span class="bolder">
       patch
      </span>
      on a 
        traditional synthesizer, sampler, or effects processing unit. This being 
        said, a preset is simply a snapshot of the current state of a machine, 
        which may be recalled at any time - or even shared with others. Both Generators 
        and Effects equally support presets in an identical fashion.
      <br />
<br />
      Using presets is extremely simple. To recall one, simply
      <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
        select 
        it from the drop-down
       </font>
</b>
      list on the upper left of any machine. 
        The parameters will now immediately change to that of the preset.

   Presets are a wonderful way to build huge libraries of sounds which 
      may be used over and over throughout your songs. While presets are a great 
      way to create endless batches of great synth patches, they may also be used 
      to create anything from standard mastering effects for your work, to unique 
      drum kits based on existing drum machines.

   <br />
   Unlike traditional hardware,
   <span class="bolder">
      there is virtually no 
      limit to the amount of presets a single machine may posses
     </span>
   (OK, 
      technically its a couple million...but who's counting?)
