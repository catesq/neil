   Adding Columns (Machines)  to the Sequence Editor

      Note:
     </b>
   A single sequence column is created for each new generator that is 
            added to a song. The following steps need not be applied for these, 
            but are required to add sequence columns for effects, or additional 
            columns for existing generators.
   <br />
   <br />
   To add a sequence column, simply
   <span class="red">
<b>
       Right-click and Select the machine
      </b>
</span>
   from the 
            &quot;Add Track&quot; pop-up window. Alternately, this may be done 
            by pressing
   <span class="red">
<b>
       CTRL+Enter
      </b>
</span>
   , and selecting the machine with the up 
            and down arrow keys. The machine's new sequence will now appear as 
            the furthermost right vertical column.
   <br />
   <br />

      Hint
     </b>
   : You can have separate note & parameter change patterns and when both
            patterns are played at the same time from two columns, Aldrin will play a combination of those two patterns.
            With two note patterns and four parameter change patterns you can get a total of 8 different combinations.
