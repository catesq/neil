   Navigating Between Patterns
  </div>
  <div>
   As you create more Patterns for your machines, you will want 
      to quickly navigate between them. There are currently two ways to accomplish 
      this in Aldrin.
   <br />
   <br />
   1. You may easily select the pattern by clicking the drop-down-box labeled
   <b>
      Pattern
     </b>
   on the top toolbar of the Pattern Editor.
   <br />
   2. In most cases a much faster way to switch between patterns is to 
      use the
   <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
       + (plus)
      </b>
</font>
   and
   <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
       - 
      (minus)
      </font>
</b>
   keys located on your keypad.
