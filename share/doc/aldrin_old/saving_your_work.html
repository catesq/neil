   Congratulations, You've written 
      a song in Aldrin.

  <div>
   <p>
<b>
       You have just written your first song in Buzz!
      </b>
<br />
<br />
      You may save it by either pressing
      <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
        CTRL-S
       </font>
</b>
      , or 
        selecting
      <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
        &quot;Save As..&quot;
       </font>
</b>
      from the file menu
      , just as 
        in any other application.
      <br />
<br />
      Experiment more with this song, as it combines many of the basic fundamentals 
        of Aldrin. Add more Generators and Effects, create more patterns and add 
        them to the sequencer to hear their results.
      <br />

       Important Note:
      </b>
      Its 
            a good idea to save this file, as we will return to it 
            eventually.
