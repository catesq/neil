      Configuring MIDI Input

  </div>
  <div>
   One of the most useful features in Aldrin is its
   <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
       support 
      for continuous MIDI controllers
      </b>
</font>
   (usually knobs or sliders) 
      to control any of the machine parameters throughout its library. The latest machines also support 
	  wellknown MIDI-notes input, in order for you to control the notes of those machines with your 
	  MIDI-keyboard and record them when you have record (
   <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
       F7
      </b>
</font>
   ) enabled.
   <br />
   <br />
   <b>
      Note:
     </b>
   Before 
      MIDI controllers may be used to control Aldrin parameters, they must be
   <b>
<a href="
	  binding_(adding)_controllers.html">
       binded
      </a>
</b>
   to a name within this dialog.
   <br />
   <br />
   <b>
      Important Note:
     </b>
   It is very important to be sure your
   <b>
      MIDI In
     </b>
   is working before you can start binding controllers or playing notes with your MIDI keyboard. Very quickly you should 
      know if something is wrong. If so, use a tool such as
   <font color="#0000FF">
<a href="http://www.midiox.com" target="_blank">
       MIDI-OX
      </a>
</font>
   to troubleshoot your MIDI problems. For troubleshooting MIDI specifically within Aldrin you should rather use
