   Giving Patterns Length

   <p>
      The drop-down box found in the New Pattern dialog (Figure 
      2.2) enables you to specify the length of a pattern in rows (more on

      later). Pattern lengths in Aldrin may range from 1 (useful for triggers) to 
      512. This allows a huge amount of flexibility based on how you choose to 
      write music. While most choose to stay between 16 and 64, your own style 
      is up to you.
      <br />
<br />
      While the length of patterns has no effect on 
            the efficiency 
            of Aldrin itself, it may have an effect on your efficiency. 
            You may want to keep patterns somewhat short - and make 
            them longer when needed.

      When you adjusted the size of the pattern 
            but when you press play, the added part of the patterns doesn't 
            seems to be played, check whether you adjusted the space reserved 
            for the pattern in the

</strong>
      .
      <br />
<br />
      Remember that pattern lengths may be changed at any time by simply opening 
      the Pattern Properties dialog with with
      <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
        Ctrl-Backspace, 
      or a right-mouse click.
       </font>
</b>
      Please 
            remember that when increasing the size of a pattern, the extra 
            length will be appended to the current pattern. Decreasing a pattern 
            has the adverse effect.

<strong>
       Note:
      </strong>
      All data past the 
      new length specified will be chopped off. Be careful though as this can 
      not be undone. I will repeat,
      <span class="bolder">
       when shortening patterns 
      - you will lose all notes and values past the new length. This cannot be 
      undone.
