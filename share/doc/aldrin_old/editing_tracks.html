      Adding Tracks
      <br />
</span>
   <br />
   Adding tracks is accomplished by pressing
   <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
       Ctrl 
      +
      </b>
</font>
   , or
   <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
       Right-Clicking and Selecting &quot;Add 
      Track&quot;
      </b>
</font>
   from the pop-up menu. As mentioned earlier, added tracks 
      differ from machine to machine. Some machines (such as the Voidsynth) only duplicate 
      the velocity and note columns, while others (such as the Jeskola Delay) 
      duplicate all of their parameters.

      Deleting Tracks
     </span>
   <br />
   <br />
   If you wish to delete a track, press
   <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
       Ctrl -
      </b>
</font>
   (minus) or
   <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
       Right-Click and Select &quot;Delete 
      Last Track&quot;
      </b>
</font>
   from the Pop-up. Note that you must delete the 
      last-most previously created track. This means if you have three tracks, 
      and you wish to delete the second track, you must delete the third first.
   <span class="bolder">
      Also note that this function is permanent. 
      There is no Undo.
