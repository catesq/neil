   The Wavetable Editor in Aldrin allows you to add
   <b>
      samples
     </b>
   (
   <b>
      .WAV
     </b>
   files) and
   <b>
      Instruments
     </b>
   (
   <b>
      .XI
     </b>
   files) to your songs. These waveforms 
      may then be accessed in any machine which supports the Wavetable Editor 
      (trackers, etc.).
   <br />

   To access the Wavetable Editor

   In Aldrin, the term
   <b>
      Wavetable
     </b>
   refers to a collection of samples with 
      specific attributes given to them (mainly
<b>
<a href="understanding_loops.html">
        loops
       </a>
</b>
   and
<b>
<a href="understanding_envelopes.html">
        envelopes
       </a>
</b>
   ), 
      related to one song. Therefore each song contains its own Wavetable, which 
      is composed of samples loaded from your hard-disk and saved into the .BMX 
      files.
   <br />
   <br />
   <b>
      Note
     </b>
   : To save your samples within a song (for distribution) you must 
      save the file as a .BMX. A .BMW only saves paths to the files on your hard 
      disk.
