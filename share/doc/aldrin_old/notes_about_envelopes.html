      The following notes pertain to Using Envelopes in Aldrin:
     </p>
   <ul>
<li>
       You must have a sample selected from the

</font>
       to build an envelope. If you build an envelope without a sample selected 
          it will disappear as soon as you switch windows.
       <br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       Each Envelope may only have one sustain point (for obvious reasons). 
          This Sustain point is not required.
       <br />

       spans the length of the current sample. 
          Therefore the distance between any two points will vary from song to 
          song.
       <br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       You may not delete the first and last points of an envelope.
       <br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       Each envelope is related to a sample and

       individual machine. 
          This means that you may have many envelopes for each sample, all tied 
          to separate machines.
       <br />

       Envelopes may have as many points as you wish.
