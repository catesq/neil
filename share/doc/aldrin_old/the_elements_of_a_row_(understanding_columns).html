   The Elements of a Row (Understanding 
      Columns)
  </div>
  <div>
   This topic is not the most important one to master in an early stage of Buzzing.
	When you are new to Aldrin, read this briefly, leave the things you dont understand for what they are, 
	and return to this topic later.

   Columns in a pattern may include 1, 2, 3, or 4 dots. These appear as follows:

      1. Two Dot Columns:
     </span>
   These columns represent 
      a Machine Parameter with a value ranging anywhere between 0 and 255. Data 
      entered in these columns must be expressed in a hexidecimal (hex) number 
      (explained

      </a>
</b>
   ). Technically speaking, 
      these columns contain 8-bit data.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
      2. Four Dot Columns
     </span>
   : These columns are aimed 
      at more precise (16-bit) parameter scripting. Although they function exactly 
      as 2 dot columns, they allow much larger numbers (roughly up to 65,000) 
      to be entered.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
      3. Single Dot Columns
     </span>
   : Columns with a single 
      dot signify that of a trigger. The trigger could be used for just about 
      any boolean operation in any machine. Many times they are used to trigger 
      a drum in a drum machine, while other times they are used to trigger an 
      LFO, or other such synthesis devices.

      4. Three dot Columns:
     </b>
   3 Dot columns appear usually in Generators 
      (except some drum machines). These usually indicate the ability to add notes 
      to that pattern. This will be covered shortly. It is worth noting that sometimes 
      3 dot columns will not be
   <b>
      note on
     </b>
   events, but rather
   <b>
      note slide
     </b>
   events. This a specific machine aspect. For more information on note 
            slides, we refer to the machine's documentation.
