   Aldrin starts you off at the Base octave of 4, and stretches 2 octaves across 
      your computer keyboard. This means that you have access from roughly C-4 
      to E-6, roughly two octaves. In most cases you will need to access notes in 
      higher and lower ranges then these 2 octaves.
   <br />
   <br />
   To quickly change octaves press the
   <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
       / (lower octave)
      </b>
</font>
   and
   <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
       * (higher octave)
      </b>
</font>
   located on your 
      keypad.
   <br />
   <br />
   Doing this will quickly raise or lower the base octave by 1. Repeat this 
      command as many times as needed to access the octaves you require.
   <br />
   <br />
   <b>
      Fact:
     </b>
   Aldrin supports 10 Octaves, but most machines make little effective 
      use of the more dynamic of these octaves. Most machines remain the most 
      effective from roughly C-2 to roughly C-7. This appears not only with Aldrin machines but 
	  with most audio gear.
