        The following list 
                        is composed of the most common questions we receive 
                        from people that are new to Aldrin or Buzz. This is not the first 
                        place to look more experienced buzzers. If you are more experienced, you will find everything you 
                        need on

        . If you are sure your 
                        question is not answered there, post a new topic and 
                        you'll get an answer soon.

<b>
           Is Aldrin Multi-Platform?
          </b>
<br />
	Yes. Aldrin runs on Windows and Linux.

           Who is 
            developing Aldrin?

<br />

           I just 
            Downloaded Aldrin, and its not making any noise?!
          </b>
<br />
          The first 
            step to get started, is to
          <b>
<a href="configuring_audio_in_buzz.html">

<b>
           Is Aldrin 
            Open-Source?
          </b>
<br />
Yes. You can find the source on our <a href="http://trac.zeitherrschaft.org/zzub/wiki/AldrinDownloads">download</a> page.

<b>
           Does 
            Aldrin Support MIDI?
          </b>
<br />
          Yes. In
								  
                  two different ways. First, after configuring your 
                            MIDI input settings, you can play and record 
                            notes
								  
                  just like with other MIDI-supporting software. This 
            is accomplished by the machines itsself. Not all machines support MIDI-in, 
            but the latest ones (e.g Zephod Voidsynth, MX7, FSM Infector) do. Second, the 
            Aldrin core supports audio parameter control via MIDI Continuos Controllers (the 
            knobs found on most MIDI synths). While this does not sound 
            powerful at first, it is. It gives users physical access to 
            thousands of parameters for hundreds of machines.

<b>
           What 
            native file Formats does Aldrin Use/Accept?
          </b>
<br />
          The native 
            song file format of Aldrin is .BMX. This file contains a machine layout, 
            patterns, sequence, and all samples associated with one song. A .BMW 
            is the same file, without the embedded samples. For Samples, Aldrin 
            accepts all standard Windows .WAV files, and for Instruments, Aldrin accepts 
            .XI multi-samples Fast Tracker Files. While the Aldrin machines too could 
            be considered media files, they all retain the generic .DLL extension. 
            For machine presets, Aldrin uses a proprietary .PRS file. Lastly, the 
            HDD recorder in Aldrin writes 44Khz 16bit Stereo .WAV Files.

<b>
           Does Aldrin support VST plugins and soundfonts?
          </b>
<br />
          Through tons of hard 
                            work, Rout has brought us two [among others] 
                            important machines; both of which extend the 
                            functionality of Aldrin by adding support for 
                            additional files/technologies. First off, Routs VST 
                            Plugin Loader was one of the initial breakthroughs 
                            
								in Buzz, 
            giving a free engine for Steinbergs VST Plugin architecture. Secondly, Routs Sound 
            Font Loader has enabled us to load standard .SF2 multi-sampled Sound Fonts. 
            VTS2 is beein initiated but not yet finished 
            with the VST2 loader by a team of top-developers: Rout, Zephod, Arguru 
            and FSM. This initiative isn't finished for now, yet 
            maybe in the future Aldrin will be compatible with VST2 too.
