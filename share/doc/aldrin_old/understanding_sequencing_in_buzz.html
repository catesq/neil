   Understanding Sequencing in Aldrin

  <div>
   A song begins the second the Play Button  (F5/F6) is pressed.   This function is best shown in the Sequence Editor, as it is not only a high-level view, but the very designation of pattern order for the entire song being played.
   <br />
   <br />
   As the song is played through, a bar moves down at  the speed of the current

       BPM
      </b>
</a>
   .    From there, the cursor will reach either reach a loop point, or the actual end of the song itself. 
			  Understanding this process is simple but vital to composing songs in Aldrin.
   <br />
   <br />
   The following elements are involved in sequence flow:

       Elements of the Sequence Flow:
      </strong>
</span>
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
<strong>
       1. Song Begin Point:
      </strong>
</span>
   This uppermost (and in cases with no seperate loop end point, &quot;only&quot;) hashed vertical line indicates the start of a song. While  many times the start will be at the first row (above  the first bar), it may be desired to actually start the song at a later point.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
<strong>
       2. Current 
            Point:
      </strong>
</span>
   This thicker black line  indicates the current progress of the song.  This is the only line which moves automatically as the song is played,
		reacting to the loop and end bars.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
<strong>
       3. Loop Point:
      </strong>
</span>
   The second and lower hashed horizontal line indicates that a loop has been placed.   Loops are useful to help set smaller areas to loop through while editing one portion of a song.  
            Note:
   <b>

      </strong>
</a>
   for loops to play through.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
<strong>
       4. Song End Point:
      </strong>
</span>
   This thin solid line  
			 indicates the end of a song.  If looping is disabled the song will stop at this point.  If looping is enabled, the song will loop back to the begin point endlessly until stopped by the user.
