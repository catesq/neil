      Selecting areas of patterns in Aldrin is accomplished with the 
            keyboard, just like in any other Windows application, by holding the 
            shift key and navigating with the arrow- and the page-up and page-down keys.
     </p>
   <p>
      Another way to make a selection is by simply setting the begin 
            and end point of the selection.

<span class="bolder">
<strong>
        Setting the selection begin 
            point
        <br />
</strong>
</span>
<br />
      To set the begin point of a selection, 
            move your cursor to the desired row and
      <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
        press 
            CTRL-B
       </font>
</b>
      . This will mark the position of your cursor.
      <br />

<span class="bolder">
<strong>
        Setting the Song End 
            Point
       </strong>
</span>
<br />
<br />
      To set a selection end point, move your 
            cursor to the desired row and
      <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
        press 
            CTRL-E
       </font>
</b>
      . This will expand the block you placed by 
            pressing CTRL-B to the point that your cursor is at now, marking the 
            selection area. Now that you selected one column in the pattern, by 
            pressing CTRL-E more times the selection will expand to the columns 
            nearby and after some times, will return to its first area. Just try 
            this a few times, you will be familiar with it very soon.
     </p>
   <p>
      Pressing
      <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
        Ctrl+U
       </font>
</b>
      clears the selection.
