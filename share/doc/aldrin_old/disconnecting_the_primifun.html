   Disconnecting the PrimiFun

   In order to add the Cross Delay to the PrimiFun's audio path, you must 
      first disconnect the PrimiFun from the Master.

   Disconnect the PrimiFun from the Master by

      Note:
     </b>
   Due to the completely modular nature of Aldrin, 
      we are not actually required to disconnect the PrimiFun from the Master, 
      as the PrimiFun can easily flow both through the Cross Delay and directly 
      into the Master at the same time. Yet for the purpose of this Tutorial it 
      is much easier to grasp if we deal with one audio chain at a time.
