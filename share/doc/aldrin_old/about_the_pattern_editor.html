  <div>
   The Aldrin Pattern Editor is used to create the
   <span class="bolder">
      instructions
     </span>
   for 
            the machines that create sound 
      in Aldrin. As its name indicates, the Pattern Editor serves the single purpose 
      of creating and editing items called '
   <span class="bolder">
      patterns'
     </span>
   which are used to control the output of machines.
   <br />
   <br />
   Once patterns are created, they are then sequenced to form longer portions 
      of music - and eventually full songs. Consider patterns to be the script 
      of seperate scenes in a movie, or the subroutines of a program.
