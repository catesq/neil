      Understanding Samples
  </div>
  <div>
   Before you progress into working with the Wavetable you should 
      have a general understanding of what the term
   <b>
      Sample
     </b>
   refers to. In 
      the case of
   <b>
      Wavetable samples
     </b>
   , a sample refers to a small audio file 
      which may be triggered to produce that sound within a song.
   <br />
   <br />
   One of the powers of sampling is the ability to take a single waveform and 
      play it at many different notes. This is known as
   <b>
<a href="understanding_samples_in_the_wavetable.html">
        Resampling
       </a>
</b>
   . 
            For example, resampling would allow you to record one note of a 
            piano, thus play various notes. Unfortunately in most cases problems 
            arise when playing notes too many
<em>
       semitones
      </em>
   away from the 
      originally recorded pitch (tone). This problem is solved by using
   <b>
      Multi-samples
     </b>
   (also called Instruments).
   <br />
   <br />
   A multi-sample is basically a group of samples with specific attributes 
      assigned to each sample.
   <b>
</b>
   In Aldrin, this includes
<b>
<a href="understanding_loops.html">
        loops
       </a>
</b>
   and
   <b>
<a href="understanding_envelopes.html">
        envelopes
       </a>
</b>
   . 
      In most cases each audio sample is assigned a range (known as a split) of 
      notes. Therefore when you play a specific note, the Wavetable triggers the 
      sample assigned to that note.
   <br />
   <br />
   Other instances of sampling do not require
   <b>
      resampling
     </b>
   of audio. In the case 
      of Drum Machines, only one individual note per sample is required, therefore 
      notes are not even available but rather
   <b>
      Triggers
     </b>
   instead. This is 
      true in the instance of playing a kick-drum or a snare.
   <br />
   <br />
   To add confusion, a
   <b>
      Sample
     </b>
   is also the term for the smallest unit 
      of time within an audio sample. It is equal to one byte. Most samples within 
      Aldrin play at 44Khz (although higher is possible through a method called
   <b>
      oversampling
     </b>
   ). This means that they have 44,100 samples per second 
      of audio.
   <br />
   <br />
   Unfortunately the term &quot;sample&quot; doesn't even stop 
            here. To add to even more confusion, there exists a
   <em>
      verb;
     </em>
   &quot;
   <strong>
      sampling
     </strong>
   &quot;. The very method of creating 
            samples is called Sampling. 
      Therefore to
   <b>
      Sample audio
     </b>
   refers to physically recording that audio 
      for the purpose of using those samples in other music.
   <br />
   <br />
   Lastly, the term
   <b>
      Sampler
     </b>
   refers to a device which accomplishes all of these feats. A combination 
      of the Aldrin Wavetable Editor and any Sample-oriented machine (for instance the Mathilde 
      Tracker) forms a nice Sampler device.
   <br />
   <br />
   <b>
      Important Note:
     </b>
   Aldrin does not completely fit all of the characteristics 
      of a sampler, as it does not allow you to physically record samples. Other 
      applications such as Syntrillium's

   <a href="http://www.sonicfoundry.com" target="_blank">

       Sound 
      Forge
      </b>
</a>
   (both great tools) allow you to create samples for use in 
      Aldrin.
