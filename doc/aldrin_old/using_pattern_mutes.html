   Using Pattern Mutes
  </div>
  <div>
   Much like the
<b>
       Pattern Break
      </b>
   , 
		Pattern Mutes stop the current pattern, yet unlike the Pattern Break 
		which allows the final note to play through, the Pattern Mute completely 
		mutes all audio in that channel until another pattern is called. A new pattern will 
		function as a break. So sometimes you will notice that the last notes 
		before the mute will continue playing after the new pattern is called. 
		This will not happen when there are new notes replacing the ones from before the mute.
   <br />
   <br />
   To insert a Pattern Mute, navigate to the desired row and column, then
   <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
       press the - (minus) key
      </b>
</font>
   .
			 The word &lt;mute&gt; will now appear in the row (as shown in Figure 3.6).
   <br />
   <br />
   Note Muting an effect will effectively mute all generators going into it.  If you would rather disable the effect, yet let the generators continue through unchanged - use a
   <font color="#0000FF">
<b>
       Pattern Thru
      </b>
</font>
   instead.
