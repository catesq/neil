<strong>
        Adding Patterns
        <br />
</strong>
<br />
      To add a pattern to a column, simply
      <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
        type
       </font>
</b>
      its
      <a href="understanding_the_pattern_list.html">
<b>
        Entry Key
       </b>
</a>
      (number or letter in instances of more then 10 patterns) indicated in the
      <a href="working_with_the_pattern_list.html">
<b>
        Pattern List
       </b>
</a>
      to the far right.   
			This will place the name in the currently selected bar and column.
      <br />
<br />
<strong>
        Editing Bars
       </strong>
<br />
<br />
      To edit a bar, navigate to it's  sequence column, and enter a new value to replace it.
      <br />
<br />
<strong>
        Clearing Bars
       </strong>
<br />
<br />
      To clear a 
			position in the sequence,  navigate to it and press the . (period) key.
			
			
		  The position will be replaced with three periods indicating that it is blank.  Once a bar is clear, any patterns prior to it with sufficient length will continue to play through the cleared bar.
      <br />
<br />
<strong>
       Inserting a Row into a Column
      </strong>
</p>
   <p>
      To insert a bar into the current column,
      <strong>
<font color="red" face="">
        press Insert
       </font>
</strong>
      . Now all patterns under the 
            cursor will be placed down one position.
     </p>
   <p>
<strong>
       Deleting a Row in a Column
      </strong>
</p>
   <p>
      Deleting a bar and move all the patterns under that position up 1 
            position is done by
      <strong>
<font color="red" face="">
        pressing 
            Delete
       </font>
</strong>
      .
     </p>
   <p>
<strong>
        Deleting an entire 
            Bar
       </strong>
<br />
<br />
      To delete an entire row (bar) simply 
            position your cursor within the desired row and
      <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
        press CTRL-D
       </b>
</font>
      . This will delete the 
            current row while simultaneously sliding all further rows back one 
            bar into its spot, placing the next row into its spot.
      <span class="bolder">
       Note:
      </span>
      There is no undo for this option, be 
            careful when deleting rows. It is easy to delete too many rows 
            quickly.
      <br />
<br />
<strong>
        Inserting an entire Blank 
            Bar
       </strong>
<br />
<br />
      To insert a blank row (bar) simply 
            position your cursor to the row in which you wish to follow with a 
            new blank row, and
      <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
        press CTRL-I
       </font>
</b>
      . 
            This will push all following rows down one, creating a blank row for 
            all columns.
      <br />
<br />
<strong>
        Note:
       </strong>
      Remember that working with rows and columns in the Sequencer 
            will have no effect on the patterns and machines themselves. In 
            other words, deleting columns/tracks of machines and names of 
            patterns from the sequence is safe in that it will not delete these 
            objects from the song itself.
