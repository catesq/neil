      BPM (Beats per Minute)
     </b>
   and
   <b>
      TPB (Ticks Per Beat)
     </b>
   are the 
      two main forms of timing and speed control used throughout Aldrin. These two 
      items are used to adjust the general speed of your song as well as sync 
      and time certain parameters.

   BPM is something that should be familiar to most musicians. BPM is the standard 
      way to manage time in music. It literally refers to the amount of given beats 
      per standard minute.
   <br />
   <br />
   What must
      be understood is that this is the amount of Beats Per Minute and not the 
      amount of Rows per Minute. A row is actually equal to one tick. There for 
      the number of rows in a minute is equal to the BPM times the TPB (i.e. 
      Rows per minute = TPB * BPM).

      What is a
      <b>
       Tick
      </b>
      you ask? The word 
            'Tick'&nbsp; is used to indicate the overall position in your song. 
            As stated, a Tick is represented by a single row in a pattern. Simple as that. Every row within your pattern editor is equal to one 
      Tick, and in sequence editor default one bar is equal to 16 Pattern rows, so to 16 Ticks.

      The best way to explain the concept 'Ticks per Beat' 
            is the probably the following example:
     </p>
   <p>
      You compose a trance song, you standard assign 1 bassdrum hit 
            every eight rows in the patterns of your bassdrum generator. In that 
            case, if you want to have a commonly accepted tempo and you leave 
            the BPM value between 120 and 150, you will have to set the TPB 
            value at 8. Then you have your song orientated in 8 'ticks per beat' 
            (the BPM multiplied by 8 will then give you the amount of rows that 
            cover one minute of music).

      Why does Aldrin use ticks?

   Ticks make for a nice common way to sync parameters and effects between 
      each other, as well as the current song. For example it is sometimes useful 
      to have delays be in &quot;time&quot; with the song. This means that each 
      trailing repetition of the delay would need to hit exactly on a beat, with 
      the rest of the song. While this would be very difficult to accomplish with 
      units such as &quot;milliseconds&quot;, it can be easily accomplished in 
      Aldrin by setting the delay
   <b>
      unit
     </b>
   parameter to
   <b>
      ticks
     </b>
   and then 
      defining the number of ticks. Remember that each tick is equal to a row, 
      so 4 ticks will delay every 4th row.
