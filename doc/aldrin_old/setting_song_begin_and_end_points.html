   As stated, a sequence is nothing more then a serie of patterns which trigger linked machines to produce and modify sounds.  This being the case, sometimes you do not want to listen to the entire sequence every time you are busy editing and engineering your audio.   To solve this problem, Aldrin allows you to set a song Start and End point.

   To set the Begin Point for a song, move your cursor to the desired row and
   <b>

       press CTRL-B
      </font>
</b>
   .  This will place a thin horizontal  hashed black line indicating that the song will begin there when played.
