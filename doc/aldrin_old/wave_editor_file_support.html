      Wavetable Editor File Support

  <div>
   <p>
      Aldrin supports the following file formats:
      <br />
<br />
<b>
       Windows Wave (.WAV)
       <br />
<br />
</b>
      The .WAV file was invented by Microsoft as the standard windows audio 
        file format. Windows Wave files hold data without compression and 
        loss-less quality. These files are available just about everywhere 
        and supported by nearly every audio program on the Windows platform. Aldrin 
        supports the following features of Windows .WAV files:
     </p>
   <ul>
<li>
       8 or 16 Bit
      </li>
<li>
       8kHz-196kHz (for Internal 
                oversampling)
      </li>
<li>
       Mono or Stereo (older machines may 
                experience problems with stereo samples. For playing stereo 
                samples, the most suitable machine right now is the Matilde 
          Tracker)
      </li>
</ul>
   <b>
      Fast Tracker II Instrument (.XI)
     </b>
   <br />
   <br />
   The .XI standard was invented by Triton (now Starbreeze Studios) in the 
      early 90's as a multi-sample instrument file format for their Fast Tracker 
      II tracking software. Unfortunately Aldrin does not support the full feature 
      set of .XI's (buggy Multi-sample support), but serves the purpose of saving 
      loop points well. Aldrin supports the following features of the .XI file format:
   <br />
   <ul>
<li>
       8 or 16 Bit
      </li>
<li>
       8Khz-44Khz
      </li>
<li>
       Loop Points
      </li>
<li>
       Partial Multi-sample Support (doesn't 
                correctly load all files)
       <br />
</li>
</ul>
