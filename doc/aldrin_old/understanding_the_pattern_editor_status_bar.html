   The Elements of the Pattern 
      Editor Status Bar
  </div>
  <div>
   A status bar appears at the bottom of the pattern window to 
      help simplify the process of entering Hexidecimal numbers, as well as provide 
      additional information to help navigate patterns.

   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
      1. Row Indicator:
     </span>
   As the word implies, this 
      simply lists the current row number your cursor is positioned at.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
      2. Value Indicator:
     </span>
   This column is very useful 
      for those who don't quite have a grasp on Hex numbering. This number not 
      only lists the current hex value of the column and position of the cursor, 
      but also the standard decimal numeric value. Besides this area may be 
      used to give other value units such as percentages and current note status.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
      3. Current Column Description:
     </span>
   This indicates 
      the current column your cursor is positioned in. This is usually a slightly 
      longer description than the Parameter name found in the
   <a href="elements_of_parameter_dialog.html">
<b>
       Parameter Dialog window
      </b>
</a>
   .
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
      4. Hint &amp; Ready Indicator:
     </span>
   As you move your 
      mouse over various aspects of the Aldrin interface, this indicates the function of that 
      icon or menu item. Otherwise, it should read its standard &quot;Ready to 
      rok&quot;.
   <br />
   <br />
<strong>
       Hint:
      </strong>
   If you are new to Hex code, use 
      this toolbar to gain a better understanding. When you enter hex values into Aldrin 
      columns, view their actual decimal values in this bar. You will quickly 
      catch on.
