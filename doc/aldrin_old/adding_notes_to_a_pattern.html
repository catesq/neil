   Adding Notes to a Pattern
  </div>
  <div>
   Now that your machine is connected to the master machine, you may add
   <b>
      notes
     </b>
   to it. Notes in Aldrin are added by your standard
   <b>
      PC keyboard
     </b>
   , 
      into
   <b>
      Patterns
     </b>
   within the
   <b>
      Pattern Editor
     </b>
   .
   <br />
   <br />
   To switch to the pattern editor,
    <span class="red">
<b>
       press F2.
      </b>
</span>
   <br />
   <br />
   Once you are in the pattern editor, you should verify that you are looking 
      at patterns for the correct machine, in this case the PrimiFun. The current 
      machine is marked &quot;Machine&quot; in the upper left of the screen.
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
<br />
      If the drop-down box to the left of the Machine label does not currently 
      say
      <b>
       PrimiFun
      </b>
      , change it so that it does now. This may be done with 
      either the mouse, or by scrolling with
   <span class="red">
<b>
        Ctrl-Up
       </b>
</span>
      and
   <span class="red">
<b>
        Ctrl-Down
       </b>
</span>
      .
     </span>
   <br />
   <br />
   The first pattern is 
            added when you add a generator by default, to help you start editing 
            quickly. Further patterns may be added by pressing
   <strong>
   <span class="red">
       Ctrl-Enter
      </span>
</strong>
   or 
      selecting &quot;New Pattern&quot; from the right-click pop-up menu.
   <br />
   <br />
   You will immediately notice many 
            columns of dots within the PrimiFun's Pattern. These represent the 
            various
      parameters within the PrimiFun. Which parameter each column represents can be found 
      in the underleft corner of your window. You will
   <a href="the_elements_of_a_row_(understanding_columns).html">
<strong>
       work with 
      other columns
      </strong>
</a>
   later, but for now your primary concern is the 3 dots to the 
      far left.
   <br />
   <br />
   3 dots in a pattern within Aldrin indicate that it is a note column. Notes 
      columns are usually located on the far left or right of a machine. Notes 
      are entered from your keyboard. You will learn more about which keys relate 
      to which notes, and how to switch octaves later.
   <br />
   <br />
   For now, try inserting various
   <b>
      C Notes
     </b>
   by
   <span class="red">
<b>
       typing 
      Q and Z.
      </b>
</span>
   The following should appear in the pattern editor:
  </div>
  <div>
<br/>
<img height="403" src="images/patternprimi.gif" width="382" />
<br/>
  </div>
  <div>
   If you followed these instructions, you have just inserted various C notes 
      in the 4th and 5th octave. You may use the arrow keys to go back and edit 
      them, using the . (period) to clear a column.
   <br />
   <br />
   It is worth noting that the name of this default pattern is
   <b>
      00
     </b>
   (as 
      in two zeros). This is the default name for all default generator patterns, 
      but may be
<b>
<a href="naming_&_renaming_patterns.html">
        changed
       </a>
</b>
   at any time.
   <br />
   <br />
   At this point, do not worry about the details regarding notes, sequence 
      speed, or other various musical aspects. You will learn this as you go.
