      To solo a machine so that it is the only machine currently 
      emitting sound, either double click on the LED in the upper left-hand corner, 
      or
      <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
        right-click and select solo
       </font>
</b>
      from the 
            menu. Square brackets [ ] appear around all other machines, 
            indicating that the machine you selected is currently in solo mode. 
            A check will also appear next to the word Solo in the right-click 
            pop-up indicating this status.

      Solo-ing in Aldrin doesn't mean muting all other machines. So if 
            you thouhgt you might solo one machine and then add the sound of 
            other machines one by one, I am sorry but I must dissappoint you. 
            This can only be done by muting all the machines one by one first 
            (not a very big deal, just check &quot;

   If you happen to delete 
      the currently soloed machine, simply solo and un-solo any other machine 
      (as described above).
