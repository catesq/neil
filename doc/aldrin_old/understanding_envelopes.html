      Envelopes are tools which define shape for an individual aspect of sound 
        over a short duration of time. Many times you will hear of an
      <b>
       ADSR
      </b>
      envelope. This is an envelope with 4 unique points. ADSR stands for Attack, 
        Decay, Sustain, Release. The
      <b>
       Attack
      </b>
      is the duration of the sound 
        from silence to its loudest point. The
      <b>
       Decay
      </b>
      is the duration from 
        the top of the attack to the point in which the sound sustains. The
      <b>
       Sustain
      </b>
      is a unique point in that its main purpose is to keep the sound at a constant 
        level until it is released. Finally, the
      <b>
       Release
      </b>
      is equal to the 
        duration from the sustain back to silence.
      <br />
<br />
      Envelopes may pertain to many aspects of sound including Amplitude, Pan, 
        Filter, LFO-freq, and Pitch.
      <br />
<br />
      The Sustain is a particularly important point in any sample with loops, 
        since this is the point in which the majority of the loop will be executed.
      <br />

      Envelopes are available in many instances throughout Buzz, the most obvious 
        being the

      to samples is an easy and visual way to greatly 
        alter and enhance their sounds. Envelopes also appear (mainly in non-graphical 
        form but rather as parameters) throughout various synthesizers within 
        Buzz.

       Important Note:
      </b>
      Not all machines which support samples support 
        envelopes. A good example of one that does is the
      <b>
       Mathilde Tracker
      </b>
      .
