   Designing envelopes is a very simple task in Buzz. Envelopes 
      are based on a serious of lines separated by points. You create an envelope 
      in Aldrin by adding points and dragging their handles into place. The following 
      tasks enable you to do this:
   <br />
   <br />
   <b>
      Add an Envelope Point
     </b>
   <br />
   <br />
   To add an envelope point
   <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
       left-click anywhere within 
      the black area
      </b>
</font>
   of the Envelope Editor. A new handle will appear 
      in the spot you clicked.
