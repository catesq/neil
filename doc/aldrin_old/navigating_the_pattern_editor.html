   <p>
      Navigating throughout the pattern editor within Aldrin is done entirly 
        with the keyboard. While this (like many features in Aldrin) may seem a 
        bit out of the ordinary to non-trackers, you will soon realize that it 
        is by far the fastest way to get by.
      <br />
<br />
      Taking the time to remember the following commands will greatly speed 
        up your Aldrin composing efforts:
      <br />
<br />
<span class="bolder">
       Basic Movement
       <br />
<br />
</span>
      To move between rows and columns,
      <b>
<font color="#FF0000">
        use 
        the arrow keys
       </font>
</b>
      . They operate just as you would expect them 
        to. Up and down to move throughout rows, left and right to move throughout 
        the various columns.
      <br />
<br />
<span class="bolder">
       Moving Faster through Rows
       <br />
<br />
</span>
      To move up and down in 16 note increments, use the
      <font color="#FF0000">

</font>
      and
      <b>
<font color="#FF0000">
        page-down
       </font>

      keys.
      <br />
<span class="bolder">
<br />

      </span>
<br />

      (right) a track, and
