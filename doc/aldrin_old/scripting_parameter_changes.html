   <p>
      Now that you've recorded parameters into a pattern you are free to finely 
        tweak them or add more in the pattern editor itself. To do this,
      <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
        press 
        F2
       </b>
</font>
      to switch to the pattern editor (or
      <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
        press 
        enter if you are in the Sequence Editor
       </b>
</font>
      ).
      <br />
<br />
      You should be presented with a screen much like the following, only with 
        values added in the columns representing parameters you previously tweaked:
     </p>
  </div>
  <div>
   <img src="images/primieditingparmas.gif" width="309" height="365" />
  </div>
  <div>
   Editing parameters within the pattern editor is extremely simple. 
      Position your cursor (marked in black) to the column representing the parameter 
      you wish to edit (labeled in the lower status bar) and type new values.
   <br />
   <br />
   Note: The values you are adding are most likely going to take shape in Hex 
      format. If you do not understand Hex format these may look a bit strange 
      to you (often including the letters A-F). Do not worry, Hex is

   later in the user manual.
   <br />
   <br />
   You will notice (if the song is still playing) that your edits will be heard 
      upon the next loop while the song is playing. This means that you pretty 
      much hear all changes as they happen - as soon as the song progresses to 
      their point.
   <br />
   <br />
   If you are not hearing your changes,
   <font color="#FF0000">

       press F5
      </b>
</font>
   to play the song.
