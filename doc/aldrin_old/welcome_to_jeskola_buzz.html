      There is nothing else  like Aldrin on the planet.  For the first time ever you have access to a powerful  software-based music studio; for

      . 
			The true power of Aldrin.
      <br />
<br />
      Aldrin is the first ever &quot;easy to use&quot;  free modular software based synthesizer.  What this means is that the entire system is based on objects, which may be  routed in a modular fashion, giving you the freedom to be as creative as you want.   For example, if you wish to run 3 Physical Modelling synths and a Drum Machine through 2 seperate Stereo Delays, into a Mixer, through a Compressor and Parameteric EQ, and finally out to your speakers - no problem.  Lay down your synths, connect the wires and you're done.
      <br />
<br />
<b>
       Its Expandable.
      </b>
      Aldrin introduces the concept of a Machine.
      <br />
<br />
      A Machine is an object in Aldrin which either creates or modifies sound.    
			A Machine is the equivalent of a single piece of gear in a traditional music studio. It may be a synthesizer, a sampler, a dsp effect, a mixing board, or any other piece of gear that exists in a  studio.   Every piece has the same parameters and functions you would expect to find in the studio you know and love.    Whats better is that all existing machines are free (over 200!).
      <br />
<br />
<b>
       Its in Real-Time.
      </b>
      Aldrin moves with you.
      <br />
<br />
      Every aspect of Aldrin is built to be controlled in real-time.  This means that as you tweak the resonance  on a virtual analog synth, you hear it's classic sqeualching response immediately.  The same goes for all DSP effects, samples, etc.
      <br />
<br />
<b>
       It's Built for Speed.
       <br />
</b>
<br />
      Unlike other audio packages which require a super-computer to power a   single synth, Aldrin has been programmed for speed.  
			 It is not at all uncommon to employ 10 completely seperate polyphonic synthesizers, 5 samplers, 2 drum machines, 3 mixers, and 10 DSP effects all simultaniously.  Thats on a decent machine.  A fast machine could easily triple that.
      <br />
<br />
<b>
       Its Portable.
      </b>
      A studio in a briefcase.
      <br />
<br />
      Imagine having a studio with 200 pieces of gear.  Now imagine fitting it on a  laptop and taking it anywhere with you.  It sounds like a dream  to any Musician, but its completely possible with Aldrin.   An install size of 15 megs, with a memory requirement of 32 megs.  Aldrin fits easily onto most decent laptops.
      <br />
<br />
<b>
       Its Free.
      </b>
      Is there anything else to say?
      <br />
<br />
      Thats right.  $0.00 US!  That translates to roughly 0 British Pounds, which translates to  0 Finnish Marks which translates to 0 Euros which translates to  0 Japanese Yen which translates to 0 German Marks which translates to 0 Swedish Kronda which translates to 0 Swiss Francs which translates to 0 Russian Rubels.
      <br />
<br />
<b>
       Its a Secret Weapon.
      </b>
      Its cooler than Rebirth.
      <br />
<br />
      Don't be mistaken.  Aldrin is not a Soft-Synth.  Aldrin is not a Tracker.  Aldrin is not a Sequencer.  Aldrin is all of these things and more.  It is the worlds first true soft-studio.  Strike that, free soft-studio.
