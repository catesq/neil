   Using Pattern Breaks
  </div>
  <div>
   On many occasions it is useful to break a pattern's progress, where in you wish to stop all future notes, yet let the last notes continue through their envelope.
   <br />
   <br />
   You may break the progress of a pattern at any time by
   <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
       pressing the , (comma) key
      </b>
</font>
   after it has been started.  The word &lt;break&gt; will then appear in the row (as shown in Figure 3.5).
  </div>

   <p>
      A Pattern Break may also be used to undo a Pattern Mute or a 
            Pattern Thru further in the sequence. So entering a mute after a 
            pattern of a tracker which plays a long speech sample, two bars 
            later a break, two bars later a mute, a break, etc, will result in 
            that speech sample played in parts of 32 ticks (when step value is 
            set to 16, as it is by default).
