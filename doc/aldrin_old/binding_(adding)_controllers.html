      Binding (Adding) Controllers:

  </div>
  <div>
   <p>
      Take the following steps to configure MIDI controllers in Aldrin:
      <b>
</b>
</p>
   <ol>
<li>
       First you must select an appropriate device from the list of available 
          MIDI devices. In most cases, the first listed will be your default device 
          and the device you wish to use. You may have other preference. If so 
          select it from the list now.
       <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       To bind a controller to a name in Aldrin, first click the
       <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
         Add...
        </font>
</b>
       button pictured above. The following window should now appear:
       <br />
<br />
<img height="149" src="images/pref_addcontroller.gif" width="249" />
<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       You will quickly notice that the OK button is grayed out. This is 
          because Aldrin is waiting for you define a controller for which to bind. 
          You do this by moving any valid continuous controller on your MIDI device. 
          If your MIDI is functioning correctly you will see the controller number 
          and MIDI channel displayed as so:
       <br />
<br />
<img height="149" src="images/pref_addcontroller2.gif" width="249" />
<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       Clicking OK on the dialog above will bind the MIDI device. You 
          may now bind MIDI to any parameter in Aldrin.
      </li>
</ol>
  </div>
  <div>
   Continue this for all controllers on all devices you wish to bind. Note 
      that you may bind devices on multiple MIDI channels, but only one MIDI device.
   <br />
   <br />
   The most common MIDI-controller is a plain MIDI-keyboard with a pitch control and a modulation wheel.
	  Don't forget that you can use the modulation wheel for 128 different parameters by 
	  assigning it to different MIDI-controls. This assigning is done with your MIDI-keyboard, not with buzz.
	  When you assigned another control to the modulation wheel, you can go through the former four steps again and 
	  thus re-use the modulation wheel for 128 different bindings.
   <br />
   <br />
   <b>
      Note:
     </b>
   This process only needs to be done once per controller. After you have binded 
      names to your controllers, you may bind controllers to them in any song. 
      That song then saves the binding information so that you may continue to 
      control the same parameter with the same controllers in the future.
