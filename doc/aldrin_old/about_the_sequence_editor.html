   The Aldrin Sequence Editor (or Sequencer) is the final step to composing songs in 
      Aldrin. The sequencer allows you to give the machine's patterns defined order, which then result 
      in complete songs.
   <br />
   <br />
   The Sequence Editor is accessed by pressing the
   <span class="red">
<b>
       F4
      </b>
</span>
   key from any screen  within Aldrin.
   <br />
   <br />
   <span class="bolder">
<strong>
       Sequences are created  in two simple steps:
      </strong>
</span>
   <br />
   <ol>
<li>
       Columns which  represent machines are added to the sequence
       <br />
</li>
<li>
       Patterns are added to these columns in the order in which you wish them played.
      </li>
</ol>
   The combination of these two steps form the basis of a complete song, which you may then modify to perfection.
   <br />

<strong>
       General 
            Concepts:
      </strong>
</span>
   <br />
   <ul>
<li>
       When played, a sequence flows vertically from top to bottom, from the beginning of the song to the end.

<b>
         Loops
        </b>
</a>
       may be set to help when writing sections of the song.
       <br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       Each column is equal to a machine, and each row (bar)  is meant to trigger patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no limit to the amount of columns or bars a song may have.
       <br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       Each song has one sequence, which is played vertically from top to 
          bottom, just like the
       <span class="blue">

</span>
       .
       <br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       The sequence is just an arrangement of current patterns, using existing machines to create and modify sounds.  The sequencer itself has absolutely no destructive power over other objects in the current song, including both  patterns and machines. In other words,
       <span class="bolder">
<strong>
         deleting columns or rows   from a sequence does not delete those machines or patterns  from the song.
        </strong>
</span>
<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       Generators are automatically given a column in the Sequence Editor.  Effects are not given a column, although they may be added.
       <br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       Both Generators and Effects may have multiple columns assigned to them.
       <br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       For a pattern to play, it must be placed somewhere in the sequence editor.
       <br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       To hear notes as you type  them, any single pattern for the current machine must be placed 
					in the Sequence Editor.
      </li>
</ul>
