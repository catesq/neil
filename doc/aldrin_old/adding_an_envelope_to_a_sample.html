      Envelopes are located in the bottom right of the
      <b>
       Wavetable Editor
      </b>
      . 
        To enable them you must
      <b>
<a href="adding_machines.html">
         add 
        a machine
        </a>
</b>
      that uses them to the current song. The Jeskola 
        Tracker is a good example of a machine which uses envelopes. Once you 
        have a valid machine in your song, follow these steps to add an envelope:
     </p>

<li>
       Be sure to
       <b>
        enable the envelope
       </b>
       by
       <b>
<span class="red">
         un-checking 
          the disabled

       box.

<li>
<span class="red">
<b>
         Click anywhere in the black envelope window
        </b>
</span>
       to add handles. You may then edit these handles by clicking and dragging 
          into any form you wish. You may also use the
<b>
<a href="adsr_envelope_editor.html">
          ADSR 
          tool
         </a>
</b>
       to help shape complex envelopes.

<br />
<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
       Select a Sustain point by right-clicking on a point's handle and enabling 
          the Sustain option. A check will appear next to the word sustain along 
          with a vertical hashed line indicating that this point is the single 
          sustain point for this envelope.

       In this example an
       <b>
        amplitude
       </b>
       envelope has been placed on a
       <b>
        Jeskola Tracker
       </b>
       . This envelope will now 
                be applied every time this sample is played. You are free to 
                edit this envelope at any time.
       <br />
</li>
</ol>
   <p>
<b>
       Note
      </b>
      : Remember that each envelope is related to a sample and
      <b>
       one
      </b>
      individual machine. This means that you may have many envelopes for each 
        sample, all tied to separate machines.
