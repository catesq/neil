  <div>
   To let machines play notes and change parameters while you 
      play the song - instructions are required. In this case you use 
      patterns to registrate those instructions.
   <br />
   <br />
   Before you may create a pattern, you need to make sure you are currently 
      viewing the correct machine within the pattern Editor. Follow these steps 
      to ensure you are in the right place:
   <br />
   <br />
   1.
   <b>
<font color="#ff0000">
       Press F2
      </font>
</b>
   , 
            or click the
   <b>
<font color="blue" face="">
       Pattern Editor icon
      </font>
</b>
   .
   <br />
   2.
   <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
       Select the dropdown box labeled &quot;Machine&quot;
      </b>
</font>
   with either your mouse or Keyboard (
   <font color="red" face="">
<strong>
       Alt-M
      </strong>
</font>
   ), to 
      ensure you are using the correct machine.
   <br />
   3.
   <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
       Select the machine
      </b>
</font>
   you 
      are attempting to create a Pattern for.
   <br />
   <br />
   <b>
      Note:
     </b>
   For generators alone, automatically a blank 
      pattern is created when they are entered in the machine editor. 
	  You may use this pattern (premarked &quot;
   <span class="bolder">
      00
     </span>
   &quot;) 
      as your first one. You may
   <b class="bolder">
<a href="naming_&_renaming_patterns.html">
       rename
      </a>
</b>
   it at any time.
   <br />
   <br />
   Patterns are created by using either the mouse or keyboard. With the mouse, 
      Patterns are created by
   <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
       right-clicking anywhere 
      on the pattern editor, and selecting &quot;New Pattern...&quot;
      </b>
</font>
   from the pop-up menu. Creating a pattern with the keyboard is accomplished 
      by simply hitting
   <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
       Ctrl-Enter
      </b>
</font>
   . Once you 
      have done either of these actions, you will be presented with the following 
      dialog box:
  </div>
  <div>
   <img height="100" src="images/newpattern.gif" width="242" />

  </div>
  <div>
   This dialog box gives you 2 simple options. 
            First, you have the option to
   <b>
<a href="naming_&_renaming_patterns.html">
       name your pattern
      </a>
</b>
   .
