      Patterns are best described as a matrix containing specific instructions 
        to create music. In a sense, they are programmed by the user using a 
        plain QWERTY keyboard rather then the traditional entry from a (MIDI) 
        keyboard or other instrument. With the machines that support MIDI-in, the notes may also be recorded in 
		realtime by enabling record (

</font>
      ) and playing the notes on a MIDI-keyboard.
      <br />
<br />
      While entering notes with the keyboard may at first seem 
        limiting, users become accustomed to this type of editing and catch 
        on to its power and versitility very quickly. For the MIDI-addicted, the machines mentioned above that 
        support the direct recording of MIDI-note-commands from an external MIDI-device to a pattern will 
		work just as fine as any other midi-orientated application.
