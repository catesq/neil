   Adding Notes to Patterns
  </div>
  <div>
   In most cases, producing sound from a generator means adding notes 
      (sometimes triggers, covered

</b>
   ). 
      As mentioned previously, this is most usually done via a standard computer keyboard. 
	  For MIDI-fanatics; it is very possible to directly record the notes you play on 
	  your midicontroller to a pattern. One obvious thing: make sure you use 
	  machines that support MIDI-input.
   <br />
   <br />
   To add notes via your computer keyboard: when in the Aldrin pattern editor, 
	  many keys on your keyboard are used primarily 
      for note entry. To explain the key-to-note orientation most easily, I will 
      present them visually. The following is the key-set which acts as a musical 
      keyboard. Please note that these keys cover slightly over 2 octaves at a time, 
      and are displayed in octaves from top to bottom, left to right.

      Note:
     </b>
   While this section is completely familiar to most trackers, studio 
            musicians and newbies will begin their Aldrin voyage in a wondering about 
			how in the world you can use a computer keyboard as musical keyboard. 
            One thing to remember is that the keys flow in the much same order 
            as they do on a real keyboard - meaning left to right starting at C 
            (

<strong>
       Z
      </strong>
</span>
   ). Also remember 
      that you always have access to two octaves at once. A higher octave sites 
      on the top of your keyboard, while a lower octave sites on the bottom.
