   Notes in Aldrin operate exactly as they do in any other musical 
      instance in the world. Aldrin supports 10 octaves of sound, starting at C-0, 
      and ending at B-9. Aldrin also supports polyphony on a generator basis, allowing 
      you to create create chords (see
   <b>
<a href="understanding_tracks_in_buzz.html">
       Tracks
      </a>
</b>
   ) 
      of synths and samples.

   I will admit that this title may be somewhat misleading. It is far beyond 
      the scope of this document to explain musical theory and notes to Aldrin users. 
      There are plenty of great documents scattered throughout the web. Learning 
      and understanding music theory will not only help you in Buzz, but in all 
      music software. It is stronly suggested that you do so.
