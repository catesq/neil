Importing and Exporting Presets

   Part of the fun of creating presets is sharing them. 
      Even more fun is downloading from the

   . To 
      import new presets, you will need to obtain machinename.prs files. Each machine 
      has its own presets file, which will always start with its name. Once 
      you have gotten a hold of a .prs file, follow these steps.

   <br />
   1. Load the specific machine (*.prs), open the parameter dialog.
   <br />
   2.
   <b>

   on the parameter dialog, 
      as if you were going to edit presets.

   , and select the file 
      on your hard disk.
   <br />
   <br />
   You will now have a new group of presets for that machine.

   Another way to use new presets is 
      to drop the .prs file in the directory of the machine (either gear/effects 
      or gear/generators.) You most likely do not want to do this. The problem 
      is that it will overwrite any existing presets linked to that machine. It 
      is always better to import presets instead.

   There is currently no mechanism within Aldrin for exporting presets - as there 
      does not need to be. Each machine in Aldrin has one .prs file associated to 
      it, which is located in the same directory of the machine (either gear/effects 
      or gear/generators). Simply copy or send this file where-ever you need.
