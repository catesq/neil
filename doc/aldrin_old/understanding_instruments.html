   <p>
      Aldrin supports the concept of Instruments. An
      <b>
       Instrument
      </b>
      is a small 
        collection of samples with specific attributes linked to each. These files 
        are known as Instruments because combination of the following features 
        allow Samplers to reproduce nearly any traditional existing instrument. The following 
        instrument concepts are supported by Aldrin:
     </p>
   <ol>
<li>
<b>
<font color="#0000ff">
<a href="understanding_loops.html">
          Loops
         </a>
</font>
</b>
       - Aldrin allows you to store loops for each sample in an instrument.
       <br />
<br />
</li>
<li>
<b>
<i>
         For future versions:
        </i>
<br />
<font color="#aaaaff">
<u>
          Multi-samples
         </u>
</font>
<font color="#aaaaaa">
</font>
</b>
       - Aldrin allows you to store multiple samples with each assigned their own
       <b>
        split
       </b>
       (range of notes) in the keyboard.
       <br />

<font color="#0000ff">
<b>
<a href="understanding_envelopes.html">
          Envelopes
         </a>
</b>
</font>
       - Each instrument may have an amplitude envelope.
      </li>
</ol>
   <p>
<b>
       An Instrument is more then a Multi-sample
       <br />
</b>
<br />
      In many cases Instruments are refered to as Multi-samples. While partially 
        correct, this is not entirely true. The concept of a multi-sample only 
        includes various samples split over the range of the keyboard. An Instrument 
        on the other hand includes this feature along with the ability to store 
        other various information as well (in the case of Aldrin - Loops and Envelopes).

<br />
       Poor Existing .XI Support
       <br />
<br />
</b>
      Unfortunatly Aldrin's abilities to work with many existing
      <b>
       Multi-sampled
      </b>
      Instrument (.XI) files are very weak at the moment. This does not effect however, the 
        performance or ability of an instrument once it is loaded into a song. 
        It should function correctly without problems in that song. Unfortunatly 
        exporting .XI files from a song is not currently possible within Aldrin.
