      Loading Templates
     </span>
   <br />
   <br />
   One of the most useful features of templates, is the ability to access them 
      from your
   <font color="#0000FF">
<b>
       Add Machine
      </b>
</font>
   pop-up menu. To 
      load a template, simply
   <font color="#FF0000">
<b>
       right-click anywhere on 
      the Machine Editor, and select the Template of your choice from Templates
      </b>
</font>
   located on the "New"-menu. Of course you must have saved or downloaded some templates before.
   <br />
   <br />
   The other way to load a template is to select &quot;Import Song&quot; from 
      the first pop-up screen, when right-clicking on the pattern editor.

      Saving Templates
     </span>
   <br />
   <br />
   Saving templates is extremely easy, since in fact a template is nothing 
      more then a song. Therefore, save a template just as you would any song. 
      The one difference is that Aldrin provides one specific location which templates 
      may be accessed from the "new machine" pop-up menu. This location is:
   <br />
   <br />
   <b>
      &nbsp;/Aldrin/Gear/Templates/
      <br />
<br />
</b>
   All Aldrin song files located in this directory will be available from 
      the Add machine pop-up menu in the Machine Editor.
