   Using Pattern Thrus (Effects Only)

  <div>
   <p>
      To allow generators to pass through an effect unchanged by that effect, you may use a Pattern Thru.  This will temporarily disable the effect while letting the generators play through.
      <br />
<br />
      To insert a Pattern Thru, navigate to the desired row and column, then
      <font color="#ff0000">
<b>
        press the _ (underscore) key
       </b>
</font>
      .
The word &lt;Thru&gt; will now appear in the row (as shown in Figure 3.7).
      <br />
</p>
   <p>
      A Pattern Thru is disabled when the sequence runs into a 
            &lt;break&gt;.
     </p>
   <p>
<br />
      It it worth mentioning that not all 
            effects work with the thru command. While it was in the original 
            documentation regarding coding machines, it was missed on various 
            occasions. Jeskola, newer, and future machines should make better 
            use of the Pattern Thrus.
