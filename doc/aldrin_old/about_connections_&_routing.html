   Routing is the most powerful and unique feature in Aldrin. 
      Due to this fact, understanding it is extremely important to working efficiently 
      and creatively with Aldrin. Routing could be defined simply as the flow of 
      audio as it is led from its source, through various filters, and finally 
      on to the output of your audio card. Routing is a blueprint.
   <br />
   <br />
   To conquer this understanding, the following has been separated into general 
      genres of user:

<strong>
       Studio Musicians
      </strong>
</span>
<br />
   <br />
   Musicians accustomed to traditional gear and studios could easily relate 
      Aldrin routing to a room with many synths, routing into many effects, finally 
      routing out to a single destination (a mixing board leading to an amplifier). 
      In a sense, routing in Aldrin is exactly like a traditional studio; only it 
      allows much easier routing then physical, which is usually tied to wire-crowded 
      patch bays. Any studio musician will quickly realize that Aldrin is by far 
      the lightest and most portable &quot;studio&quot; ever devised.

<strong>
       Trackers
      </strong>
</span>
<br />
   <br />
   To many of the tracker-scene, Aldrin is an overly-complex beast. You are most 
      likely well situated in older DOS based software such as
   <b>
<a href="converting_from_impulse_tracker_to_jeskola.html">
       IT 
      or FT2
      </a>
</b>
   . This is expected to be your history - and basically 
      a thriving underground culture. What you need to understand is that Aldrin 
      is simply the next generation of what you are already accustomed to. Aldrin 
      offers nearly everything you are familiar with, yet including the addition 
      of a modernized modular architecture allowing it to grow and expand unlike 
      any tracker to date.
   <br />
   To explain Aldrin to you would be to consider Aldrin an endless 
      amount of trackers (such as FT2 and IT) side by side in one framework. Yet 
      rather then considering a track to do nothing more then play samples, Aldrin 
      allows different sound-sources to produce completely unique sounds, not 
      based on samples in any way - but completely synthesized mathematical. Of 
      course, Aldrin includes sample based tracking as well. You should think 
      of sequencing much like original tracker packages as well, only in a much 
      more powerful fashion. Rather then having a single column by which to sequence 
      patterns, Aldrin adds the ability to sequence a virtually unlimited number 
      of trackers, synths, and effects side by side - all at once. Throw on top 
      the ability to connect in a modular fashion to hundreds of effects, and 
      the ability to script any parameter of any of these effects or synthesizers 
      - and you have something more powerful then any of the original Tracker 
      creators could have ever imagined - and on top of that, you still have your 
      sample based trackers
   <i>
      in a familiar format
     </i>
   (Cubase will never offer 
      that!).

   Those 
            of you new to digital music may at first find the concept of Aldrin a bit 
            strange. Well, it is. To you, there is little to say other then, 
            &quot;continue to experiment&quot;. Aldrin is built based on many 
            concepts - all of which are listed throughout this user guide. Read 
            everything and continue to experiment. Also, some experienced Aldrin 
            users set up useful sites like

     </a>
   . To get into the scene a bit more,

   . If all else 
            fails, download an IRC client, and jump into #aldrin on Freenode (irc.freenode.net). 
      Someone will be glad to help you.

   Just keep in mind that generators may connect to effects, effects may connect 
      to effects, and everything can connect to the master. Beyond these basic 
      rules, you are free to be as creative as you wish. If you would like a

   to connect to a
