    <para>
      Select a column by double clicking on it, or select a range in the
      column by clicking and dragging with the mouse. After you have the
      selection, right click on the pattern editor and select
      "Envelope". This will invoke the envelope editor displayed
      below.

    <para>
      If there was data already in the selection, the envelope editor
      will attempt to re-create an envelope from it. This process
      involves first adding a point for each rows' value to the
      envelope. After that, the envelope is pruned to remove points that
      are linear interpolations of the points on both sides of
      them. This means basically that if a point is an average of the
      points on boths sides, it will be deleted. This does not remove
      any information since that point does not contain any new
      information not present in the points that are its' neighbors. It
      also makes the envelope clearer and easier to edit. Please note
      however, that due to the limited resolution of the tracker column
      format, after you apply an envelope to a column and then
      reconstruct it using the envelope editor later, the two envelopes
      won't always (most of the time) be the same. They will, hopefully,
      be similar enough though.
